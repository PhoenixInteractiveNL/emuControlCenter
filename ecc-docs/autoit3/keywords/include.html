<p>Includes a file in the current script.<br></p>

<p class="codeheader">
<b>#include</b> "[path\]filename"<br>
<b>#include</b> &lt;filename&gt;<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parameters</b></p>
<table border="1" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" bordercolor="#C0C0C0">
  <tr>
    <td width="15%">filename</td>
    <td width="85%">The filename of the current script to include. Path is optional. <b>This must be a string--it cannot be a variable.</b><br>
       If <b>"..."</b> is used, the filename is taken to be relative to the current script.<br>
       If <b>&lt;...&gt;</b> is used the filename is taken to be relative to include library directory (usually C:\Program Files\AutoIt3\Include).  The include library contains many pre-written user-functions for you to use!</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Remarks</b></p>
In an AutoIt script, other scripts can be included using the #include" command.<br>
<br>
For the include library syntax (#include &lt;file&gt;) to work AutoIt must have been installed using the supplied installer otherwise the installation directory will not be known and the current script directory (@ScriptDir\Include) will be used instead.<br>
<br>
If you include the same file containing a user-function more than once you will get a "Duplicate function" error.  When writing an include file that may be used in this way, make sure that the top line contains <b>#include-once</b> to prevent that file from being included more than once.<br>
<br>
There is a special registry value that can be created at "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\AutoIt v3\AutoIt" called "Include".  It should be a REG_SZ (string) value.  The contents of this value are a semi-colon delimited list of directories that should be searched for files when resolving #include's in addition to the standard locations.<br>
<br>
The search order used by AutoIt depends on which form of #include you use.  The tables below show the order directories are searched using both forms.<br>
<br>
Using #include &lt;&gt;<br>
<table border="1" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" bordercolor="#C0C0C0">
  <tr>
    <td width="15%">Standard library</td>
    <td width="85%">The path of the currently running interpreter with "\Include" appended is searched.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>User-defined libraries</td>
   <td>The registry value mentioned above is read and each directory is searched in the order they appear in.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Script directory</td>
   <td>The directory of the currently executing script.</td>
  </tr>
</table><br>
Using #include "" (This is the reverse of #include &lt;&gt;).<br>
<table border="1" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" bordercolor="#C0C0C0">
  <tr>
    <td width="15%">Script directory</td>
    <td width="85%">The directory of the currently executing script.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>User-defined libraries</td>
   <td>The registry value mentioned above is read and each directory is searched in the reverse order they appear in.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Standard library</td>
   <td>The path of the currently running interpreter with "\Include" appended is searched.</td>
  </tr>
</table><br>
A note about using the /AutoIt3ExecuteScript option.  Since the standard library is searched for in the current interpreter's directory, the standard library functions will not be found; that library will only be found when run through AutoIt3.exe.  It's recommended that you compile a script to the .a3x format before attempting to run it with /AutoIt3ExecuteScript.<br>
<br>
Aut2Exe uses the same algorithm as AutoIt3.exe with the only difference being it looks for the Include sub-directory as being in a sibling directory to itself (..\Include).<br>
<br>
If Opt("TrayIconDebug",1) only 64 include files name can be displayed in the traytooltip. for the other no filename will be displayed.<br>
