The Nintendo 3DS is a portable game console produced by Nintendo. It is an autostereoscopic device capable of projecting stereoscopic 3D effects without the use of 3D glasses or additional accessories. Nintendo announced the device in March 2010 and officially unveiled it at E3 2010 on June 15, 2010. The console succeeds the Nintendo DS, featuring backward compatibility with older Nintendo DS and Nintendo DSi video games, and competes with the Sony PlayStation Vita handheld console.
 
In addition to its glasses-free 3D screens, Nintendo 3DS offers new features such as StreetPass and SpotPass, powered by Nintendo Network; augmented reality, using its 3D cameras; and Virtual Console, which allows owners to download and play games originally released for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Sega Game Gear and Nintendo Entertainment System. It is also pre-loaded with various applications including: Nintendo eShop, an online distribution store, Miiverse, an integrated communication system or social networking service; an Internet Browser; Nintendo Video, Netflix and Hulu Plus; Swapnote (known as Nintendo Letter Box in Europe and Australia), a messaging application; and Mii Maker.
 
The Nintendo 3DS was first released in Japan on February 26, 2011, and worldwide beginning in March 2011 Less than six months later on July 28, 2011, Nintendo announced a significant price reduction from US$249 to US$169 amid disappointing launch sales. The company offered ten free Nintendo Entertainment System games and ten free Game Boy Advance games from the Nintendo eShop to consumers who bought the system at the original launch price. This strategy was considered a major success, and the console has gone on to become one of Nintendo's most successfully sold handheld consoles in the first two years of its release. As of September 30, 2013, all Nintendo 3DS models combined have sold 34.98 million units. 

A larger model of the console, the Nintendo 3DS XL, was released in Japan and Europe on July 28, 2012, and worldwide beginning in August 2012. It features screens that are 90% larger than the original Nintendo 3DS. An 'entry-level' version of the console, the Nintendo 2DS, was released in North America, Europe and Australia on October 12, 2013. While still playing Nintendo 3DS and DS games, it removes the autostereoscopic (3D) functionality, and changes the form factor to a fixed, 'slate' design.
