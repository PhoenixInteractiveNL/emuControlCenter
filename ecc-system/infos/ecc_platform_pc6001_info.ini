The NEC PC 6001 is the first member of the great NEC PC family. During the 80's and the beginning of the 90's, the big Japanese electronics companies launched several series of computers, they were very powerful and had great features (some of them were costly options or totally non-existent on European or American computers at the time), the FM series from Fujitsu, the JR series from Matsushita (Panasonic), the Pasopia from Toshiba, the Basic Master from Hitachi, the X1 and X680x0 series from Sharp and all the MSX computers are good examples of this. 

The NEC PC series was among them, they had a really great success and the later models of this family are still use today. 

The NEC PC-6001 also had an American version, called the NEC TREK, or the NEC PC-6001A. Its ROMs are different from its Japanese progenitor.
