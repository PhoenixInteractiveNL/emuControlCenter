emuControlCenter (ecc) is a tool to managing and searching rom-files of various platforms. It has the ability to edit meta-data, could handle screenshots and have many search and limit functionalities.
ECC is not an emulator, but could start media from his gui in assigned emulators.

2005:
Andreas Scheibel (DE) Starts developing ecc in late november 2005, using python as programming-language. This attempt was canceled in late december 2005.

2006:
In may 2006, ecc was written from the scratch in PHP-GTK2 to take a look, if PHP-GTK2 is useable for this kind of project.
In late October 2006, the first public beta of emuControlCenter arrives.
Sebastiaan Ebeltjes (NL) saw a potential in the program ECC and becomes the first beta tester, Sebastiaan tested ECC and made some requests what other emulator frontends lack or fail to do.
This was a succes formula!, giving ECC a good start, a real good program was giving birth!
The first release of ECC to the public was a fact!, v0.5.897 Beta was released on 29.12.2006.

2007-2009:
Andreas Scheibel and Sebastiaan Ebeltjes worked continuously on ECC, giving it dozens of new features, tools and platforms!
Mostly Andreas made the 'core' PHP changes and Sebastiaan made many tools in VB6 (later on Autoit3) language and added new platforms.
ECC grows fast!, leaving most frontends far behind, ECC is at this point the best frontend that could be found, supporting over more then 120 platforms!

2009-2012:
Andreas Scheibel has left the ECC project, till today the actual reason remains unknown, we (also forum members) assume there has been problems in his private sphere.
Still many bugs remain in ECC 'beta', but Sebastiaan continues working on ECC, also he put ECC out of the 'beta' state when releasing v1.1 on 08.07.2012.

As of today still many bugs are fixed and new features are added!, visit the forum for more info!
