The Super Nintendo Entertainment System, also known as Super Nintendo, Super NES or SNES, is a 16-bit video game console released by Nintendo in North America, Brazil, Europe, and Australia. In Japan it is known as the Super Famicom (Super Family Computer). In South Korea, it is known as the Super Comboy and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics.

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System was Nintendo's second home console, following the Nintendo Entertainment System (often abbreviated to NES, released as the Famicom in Japan). Whereas the earlier system had struggled in the PAL region and large parts of Asia, the SNES proved to be a global success, albeit one that could not match its predecessor's popularity in Southeast Asia and North America—due in part to increased competition from Sega's Mega Drive console (released in North America as the Genesis). Despite its relatively late start, the SNES became the best selling console of the 16-bit era.


History

Even as the original NES/Famicom was at the height of its popularity, several companies were launching their own consoles. In 1987 and 1988, respectively, NEC and Sega launched their contenders: the PC Engine (known in North America as the TurboGrafx-16) and the Mega Drive (known as the Sega Genesis in North America) (one of the first 16-bit home gaming systems). Although the NES would continue to dominate the video game industry for years to come, Nintendo's hardware was beginning to show its age, and though Nintendo executives initially showed little interest in developing a new system, Sega and NEC's growing market share with consoles like the Mega Drive (Sega Genesis) and the PC Engine soon forced Nintendo to reconsider. Masayuki Uemura, the designer of the Famicom several years earlier, was put in charge of the design of the console and the Super Famicom was released in Japan on November 21, 1990 for Yen 25,000 (Dollar210 USD). An instant phenomenal blockbuster, Nintendo's initial shipment of 300,000 units quickly sold out within hours. The system was so phenomenally popular that it was said to have attracted the attention of the Yakuza, leading to the decision to ship the devices at night in order to avoid robbery. In Japan, the Super Famicom effortlessly outsold its chief rival, the Mega Drive, and Nintendo retained control over approximately 85 percent of the Japanese console market thanks, in part, to Nintendo's retention of most of its key third party developers from the Famicom, including Capcom, Konami, Tecmo, Square Co., Ltd., Koei, and Enix.

Nine months later, in August of 1991 (the earliest sources indicate August 13 1991; exact determination of the date is not possible due to the uncoordinated nature of North American retail video game releases during that era), the Super Famicom was released in North America with a newly redesigned case as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The release was an exciting surprise for North American gamers, since Nintendo had been advertising a launch date of September 9. Initially sold for a price of USDollar199, the North American package included the game Super Mario World. The SNES was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland in April of 1992 for Pound 150, with a German release following a few weeks later. The PAL versions of the console looked identical to the Japanese Super Famicom, except for labeling.

Nintendo's Japanese market dominance was, however, not repeated in the American and PAL markets. By the time of launch the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis had already become firmly entrenched in the US and PAL marketplace, helped by the lower cost of the Mega Drive/Genesis console and games, Sega's aggressive marketing in North America, and overall popularity of the console alone. In addition many U.S. gamers had come to expect backwards compatibility from console developers (as was the case with the Sega Genesis, Atari 2600 and 7800), but the SNES was not designed to play NES cartridges. This resulted in a backlash from parents who had already spent hundreds of dollars on NES games for their children. The Genesis had the option of backwards compatibility with the Sega Master System if a Dollar35 USD adapter was purchased.

Rivalry between Nintendo and Sega produced what is possibly the most notorious console war in gaming history. Nintendo would never achieve market leadership in The United Kingdom (but did very well on the European Continent), and did not manage to do so in the U.S. until 1994, benefiting from Sega's pulling out of the market and its continued production of SNES and its games well after the 32-bit era of gaming had started. In the period of the early 1990s, a blue-collar anti-Japanese sentiment had grown to maturity. While the NES was accused of shoddy construction and poor planning, the SNES was rumored to be a tool of outright economic war. The SNES was incompatible with several American-brand TVs, causing the screen to hop 3-5 times a second, or (in very rare cases) even outright backfire on the TV set. Nintendo fixed all units aftermarket free of charge, but the theory held on for years.

By 1996, the 16-bit era of gaming had ended, and a new generation of consoles, including Nintendo's own Nintendo 64, caused the popularity of the SNES to wane. In October 1997, Nintendo released a redesigned SNES 2 in North America for USDollar99 (which included the pack-in game Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island). Like the earlier NES 2, the new model was designed to be slimmer and lighter than its predecessor but lacked S-Video and RGB output, and would prove to be among the last major SNES-related releases in America. A similar redesigned Super Famicom Jr. was released in Japan around the same time. All of the American cases from the original NES to the SNES 2 were designed by Lance Barr.

Nintendo of America ceased production of the SNES in 1999. In Japan, the Super Famicom continued to be produced until September 2003 (also some new games were produced until the year 2000). In recent years, many SNES titles have been ported to the handheld Game Boy Advance, which has similar video capabilities. Some video game critics consider the SNES era "the golden age of video games," citing the many groundbreaking games and classics made for the system, whereas others question this romanticism. See video game player for more.

In 2005, it was announced that Super NES titles will be available as downloadable games for Nintendo's newest console Wii, via the Virtual Console service. So far, it is expected that all first-party games released in America will be available, including selected titles released for the console by third parties.


Regional lockout

Nintendo employed several types of regional lockout.

Game paks, depending on which market they were released in, were of different shapes. The North American model had a rectangular bottom that had inset grooves which when inserted complemented the console's shape whereas the Japanese, Korean, and PAL cartridges had a smoothed curve on the front of the cartridges with no inset grooves. Since the North American console has protruding grooves, the Japanese/PAL game paks could not be inserted without the removal of these grooves and North American game paks being completely rectangular could not fit into the slightly curved opening of the Japanese and PAL console units.

Additionally, a regional lockout chip within the console and in each game pak prevented PAL games from being played on Japanese/North American consoles and vice versa despite the fact that PAL and Japanese cartridges fit in each other's consoles. The Japanese and North American machines had the same region chip, so once the difference in the shape of the game paks was overcome, game paks were interchangeable.

The simplest way to play the Japanese and PAL game paks in the North American system was to use a Game Genie cheat device with the small rectangular piece of plastic from its top removed. This not only circumvents the problem of different game pak shapes but also removes any problem with lockout chips due to the internal design of the Game Genie.

Alternatively, various other adapters or physical modification of the console could overcome regional lockout. Plastic tabs within the game pak slot could be removed (by snapping or cutting them off), allowing a Super Famicom game pak to fit in the North American console; however, care had to be taken not to damage the game pak port.

The working chip lockout system had the hardware in the console act as a lock while the chip inside the game pak was a key. Disconnecting pin 4 of the console's lockout chip caused a situation where there were two keys and no locks. This meant that the lockout chips would not operate and could not halt the console. Games towards the end of the console's lifecycle, such as Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, could detect this deadlock situation and refuse to run, so it later became common to install a switch that disconnected and connected the lockout chip as required.

PAL consoles often faced another modification. Instead of being re-coded, most PAL games were simply slowed down from 60 Hz to 50 Hz, resulting in 17.5 percent slower gameplay and sound effects. Additionally, PAL's higher resolution was not taken advantage of, and the extra scanlines were blank, creating large black bars that letterboxed the image. This practice was common across all consoles at the time, but created a squashed and out of proportion picture. As most PAL TVs support a 60 Hz variant of PAL and the SNES hardware made such a thing quite simple to add, a switch to select 50 or 60 Hz operation was often added. Some games, such as Super Mario Kart, were sped up for the PAL market to partially counter this problem, and running these at 60 Hz resulted in even faster gameplay than normal.

As an additional form of region lockout, later games would check that the SNES was running at the speed the game was expecting. PAL games would refuse to run on 60 Hz machines and NTSC games would refuse to run on 50 Hz machines. The solution was to start the game in the native speed and then flick the switch once the region check had successfully completed.

There was an adaptor made by various third parties designed to circumvent the regional lockout issues. A player could plug the device into the SNES (either version) and then place a game that would normally not run on that particular SNES unit (e.g. a rectangular game pak that would not run in the SNES unit designed for round cartridges) into the top. Then, into the back or behind the first game pak, the player would insert another game that would work on this SNES unit. The adaptor would read the game from the main port and use the regional lockout chip programming from the back one.


Peripherals

Throughout the course of its life, a number of peripherals were released which added to the functionality of the SNES. Many of these devices were modeled after earlier add-ons for the NES: the Super Scope was a light gun similar to the NES Zapper (though the Super Scope featured wireless capabilities) and the Super Advantage was an arcade-style joystick with adjustable turbo settings akin to the NES Advantage. Nintendo also released the SNES Mouse in conjunction with its Mario Paint title. Hudson Soft, under license from Nintendo, released the Super Multitap, a multiplayer adaptor for use with its popular series of Bomberman games. It allowed support for up to eight players, although probably the only game to support 8 players is Dino Dini's Soccer.

One of the most interesting and successful first-party peripherals released for the SNES was the Super Game Boy, an adaptor cartridge allowing games designed for Nintendo's portable Game Boy system to be played on the SNES. The Super Game Boy touted a number of feature enhancements over the Game Boy, including color support (in reality, merely the ability to substitute a different color palette: the games themselves were still limited to four colors) and custom screen borders.

Like the NES before it, the SNES saw its fair share of unlicensed third-party peripherals, including a new version of the Game Genie cheat cartridge designed for use with SNES games and a variety of game copier devices. In general, Nintendo proved to be somewhat more tolerant of unlicensed SNES peripherals than they had been with NES peripherals.

Around 1993 Nintendo suffered from software piracy, with the introduction of copybox devices like the Super Wildcard and Super Pro Fighter Q. These devices from Hong Kong were supposedly sold to create a backup of a cartridge, in the event that it would break. Most people used it to play copied ROM images that could be downloaded from BBSes and the internet, or to create copies of rented video games, all activities illegal under federal law.

Japan saw the release of the Satellaview, a modem which attached to the Super Famicom's expansion port and connected to the St. GIGA satellite radio station. Users of the Satellaview could download gaming news and specially designed games, which were frequently either remakes of or sequels to older Famicom titles, released in installments. Satellaview signals were broadcast from April 23, 1995 through June 30, 2000. In the United States, the similar but relatively short-lived XBAND allowed users to connect to a network via a dial-up modem to compete against other players around the country.

During the SNES's life, Nintendo contracted with two different companies to develop a CD-ROM-based peripheral for the console. Ultimately, negotiations with both Sony and Philips fell through, and the two companies went on to develop their own consoles based on their initial dealings with Nintendo (the PlayStation and the CD-i respectively), Philips also gaining the right to release a series of CD-i titles based on popular Nintendo franchises.


Technical specifications

The design of the Super Nintendo/Super Famicom was unusual for its time. It featured a low-performance CPU supported by powerful custom chips for sound and video processing. This approach would become common in subsequent video game hardware, but at the time it was new to game developers. As a result early third-party games were of low technical quality. Developers later became accustomed to the system, and were able to take advantage of its full potential. It was the first console capable of applied acoustics in video game audio sold in North America, Europe, and Japan.

CPU 

Core: Nintendo custom '5A22', believed to be produced by Ricoh; based around a 16-bit CMD/GTE 65c816 (a version, not predecessor, of the WDC 65C816, used by the Apple IIGS personal computer).
Speed: 3.58MHz. 1.5 MIPS using strictly 16-bit instructions. The theoretical peak speed is 1.79 million 16-bit adds per second.
The CPU internally contains support circuitry for 
- Swift unsigned integer multiplication and division;
- Generating an IRQ interrupt every frame at a specific horizontal raster line, vertical raster line, or at a single point in the raster scan;
- For generating PSG sound with included 2A03 core;
The ability to block or allow the NMI interrupts on Vblank coming from the Picture Processing Unit;
Automatically or manually polling of the game controllers or other peripheral devices;
A memory-mapped 8-bit GPIO port;
A DMA unit, supporting two primary modes: 
- General DMA for block transfers, at a rate of 2.68 MB/s;
- Hblank DMA for transferring small data sets at the end of each scanline during the horizontal blanking period.
- Wait state generation.
The CPU is clocked with a 21.477MHz symmetric square wave signal (21.28137MHz for PAL systems). Memory transfer performance depends on the address block accessed and a ROM speed selection bit, with the possible speeds of 1.79, 2.68 and 3.58 MB/s.

RAM 

The 5A22 CPU has direct access to 128 kB of Work RAM.

Sound 

Sound Controller Chip: 8-bit Sony SPC700 CPU for controlling the DSP chips independent of the main 5A22 CPU. The main CPU communicates with this sound controller through a set of four memory mapped registers. 
Clock Speed: 1.024 MHz
Sound RAM: 64 kB shared between SPC700 and S-SMP
Memory Cycle Time: 279 milliseconds
Main Sound Chip: Sony S-SMP 
Hardware ADPCM decompression
8-channel PCM
Hardware sound effects: 
- Pitch modulation;
- 8-tap FIR filter (typically used for reverberation);
- ADSR and 'GAIN' (discretely controlled) volume envelopes.
Polyphony of 8 notes per voice
SFx sound chip: Sony/Nintendo S-DSP 
3-channel PCM
Second Order Low-pass Filter, one for each channel, for improved quality of low-frequency (bass) tones
Pulse Code Modulator: 16-bit ADPCM (if programmer uses 4-bit compressed ADPCM samples, expanded to 16-bit resolution, processed with an additional 4-point Gaussian sound interpolation)
Although the SNES is normally only able to output stereo sound, a few games (such as Jurassic Park) use Dolby Pro-Logic to create surround sound embedded in the stereo sound signals.

Video 

Picture Processor Unit (PPU) composed of two separate but closely tied IC packages, labeled the PPU-1 and PPU-2. Because these two chips act in unison to produce video output, they are considered here in this article as a single entity.
Video Memory: 
Video RAM: 64 kB SRAM, composed of two 32 kB chips accessed in parallel to match the data width of the PPU's 16-bit bus. 
In addition to the background layers, this memory holds the tile sets for backgrounds and sprite objects. This memory is not directly accessible to the main CPU and therefore needs to be accessed through a set of memory mapped ports only during the blanking period or forced blanking. At any other time, this memory is being used by the PPU.
544 bytes of 'OAM' (Object Attribute Memory) for defining the sprite object's position, orientation, layering priority, palette, character map index, and size.
512 bytes of 'CGRAM' (Color Generator RAM) for palette data.
Color Capability: 15-bit color depth (RGB555) for a total of 32,768 possible colors. 
Palette: 256 entries
Maximum colors per background layer per scanline: 256
Maximum colors per sprite: 16 (color 0 is always transparent)
Maximum colors on-screen: 4,096 without blending and 32,768 using the color arithmetic circuitry for transparency effects by blending multiple backgrounds together.
Resolution: between 256x224 and 512x448. Most games used common resolutions like 256x224, 256x240, 512x224 pixels. Interlace display mode is individually selectable for both the backround layers and sprites, but typically was only used for in-game menus, text boxes, and high resolution images. However, there are two games that use the interlace mode in the actual game: Ramna 1/2 and Axelay (only in Level 4). 
A mode termed "pseudo high-resolution" was rarely used, but allowed for color blending between sets of two adjacent pixels. For example: Kirby's Dream Land 3 used this mode to blend dithered sprites.
Maximum onscreen sprites: 128 (32 sprites per line, up to 34 8x8 character blocks per line).
Maximum number of sprite pixels on one scanline: 272. The renderer was designed such that it could drop the pixels of the frontmost sprites instead of the rearmost sprites if a scanline exceeded the limit, allowing for creative clipping effects.
Most common display modes: 
Pixel-to-pixel Mode 1 comprised of three scrolling layers: two 16 color (4-bit) per tile layers and one 4 color (2-bit) layer
Per scanline affine mapped Mode 7 with 256 colors per tile and hardware assisted scaling and rotation

Game cartridge size 

2 to 32-Mbit (0.25 to 4 MB) which can be accessed at two selectable speeds ('SlowROM' and 'FastROM'). Upon power up, the SlowROM speed is selected by default, unless the game's program code tells it to run at the faster speed. This allowed ROM techology to scale with the system, as all early games were SlowROM, and then most became FastROM towards the end of the SNES/SFC's commercial market lifetime.
Custom address decoders employed bank switching techniques to allow for broadder sizes, e.g. 48-Mbit (6MB) for Star Ocean and Tales of Phantasia.

Power adapter 

Transformer input: NTSC: 120 volts AC, 60 Hz, 17 watts, PAL: 240 volts AC, 50 Hz, 17 watts
Transformer output: 10 volts DC, 850 mA (NTSC), 9 volts AC, 1.3 A (PAL)

Enhancement chips

As part of the overall plan for the SNES/SFC, rather than include an expensive CPU that would still become obsolete in a few years, the hardware designers made it easy to interface special coprocessor chips to the console. Rather than require a complicated upgrade procedure found in the IBM PC Compatible world of computers, these certain enhancement chips were included inside the plug-in game cartridges themselves if needed for a specific game. This is most often characterized by an extra set of small leads under the cartridge.
Super FX: Developed by Argonaut Software, the Super FX chip is a supplemental RISC CPU that was included in certain game cartridges to perform functions that the main CPU could not feasibly do. The chip was primarily used to create 3D game worlds made with polygons, texture mapping and light source shading. Some 3D game carts that this chip can be found in are Star Fox, Doom, Dirt Trax FX, Stunt Race FX, Vortex, and Winter Gold. The chip however could also be used to enhance 2D games such as Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. This chip went through three revisions, first starting out as a Chip-on-Board epoxy glob-top in the earliest Star Fox cartridges, labeled as Mario Chip-1. Within a year, the chip was given a more conventional surface-mount package and labeled as the Super FX GSU-1, which was used in various games. Finally, the design was tweaked to become the Super FX GSU-2 chip, which had a larger address bus and was manufactured with an improved semiconductor process to allow it to reach its target clock speed of 21 MHz. Although the pinouts and maximum clock speed differ, the instruction set for the Mario Chip-1, FX 1, and FX 2 chips are identical. Star Fox 2, Comanche, and FX Fighter, all games designed to take advantage of the increased power of the Super FX GSU-2, were developed but never released for the SNES/SFC, disappointing many followers of the technology at the time.
DSP-1: This fixed-point Digital Signal Processor chip was created to allow programmers to generate more enhanced Mode 7 rotation and scaling effects in their games, and to perform very fast vector-based calculations. The chip can be found most notably in Pilotwings and Super Mario Kart, as well as a few other games. Later revisions of the chip, the 1A and 1B, were functionally the same but included bugfixes in their internal math calculations.
DSP-2: A bitmap scaling and bitplane conversion chip used only in one game cartridge, Atari's port of Dungeon Master to the SNES console.
DSP-3: An assistant chip used only in one Japanese game for the Super Famicom titled SD Gundam GX. Although this chip does handle graphics decompression and bitplane conversion, a large portion of memory inside this chip is dedicated to rendering a very complicated title screen, leading one to the likely conclusion that its inclusion was more intended to prevent the game from being easily pirated.
DSP-4: A DSP used in only one game cartridge, Top Gear 3000. It primarily helped out with drawing the race track, especially during the times that the track branched into multiple paths, which was a unique feature of this type of game at the time.
S-DD1 chip : Other than its normal processing and copy protection duties, this chip was primarily a graphics decompression chip. This allowed games to be bigger than normal by compressing the graphics data. Games that used this chip were Street Fighter Alpha 2 and Star Ocean. The game developers found it to be cheaper to add a specialized decompression chip rather than to add extra ROM space.
Cx4 chip: A chip created by Capcom. This chip was used to handle the wireframe effects, perform more general trigonometric calculations, and to help out with sprite positioning and rotation. The chip was used in Mega Man X2 and Mega Man X3.
SA-1 chip: This is an ASIC chipset with a 65c816 8/16-bit processor core, clocked at 10 MHz, containing some extra circuitry specified by Nintendo, including some fast RAM, a memory mapper, DMA, several programmable timers, and the region lockout chip. The SA-1 was a multipurpose chip that allowed games such as Kirby Super Star, Kirby's Dream Land 3, and Super Mario RPG to stay competitive in the changing marketplace during the aging SNES/SFC's final years.
SPC7110 chip: A data decompression chip used solely by Hudson in a few games.
OBC1: An object/sprite manipulation chip used exclusively in the title Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge, AKA Battleclash 2.
ST010: A chip created by Seta for general functions and handling computer cars' AI in their title. Generally thought to have been a single microcontroller unit with different mask roms on it for several Seta chips, two of which were used on SNES carts and at least one used on arcade systems.
ST011: A chip created by Seta for mostly AI functions in their Hayazashi Nidan Morita Shougi title. Likely uses the same microcontroller core as the ST010.
ST018: A chip created by Seta for as-of-yet unknown (but probably AI related) functions in their Hayazashi Nidan Morita Shougi 2 title. Likely does NOT use the same core as the other two Seta chips due to a changed pin count.
S-RTC: a real-time clock chip used in one title, Dai Kaiju Monogatari 2.
?X-RTC?: a slightly different real-time clock chip used only in Hudson's Far East of Eden Zero cart, which also used an SPC7110 chip.
SGB CPU chip: This chip was used only inside the Super Game Boy peripheral and possessed a core identical to the CPU in a regular handheld Game Boy. Because the Super Nintendo was not powerful enough to use software emulation to simulate the Game Boy, circuitry equivalent to an entire Game Boy had to sit inside of the cartridge. The SGB CPU ran the main program from the inserted Game Boy cartridge, but relied upon the host Super Nintendo system to write to memory mapped registers the state of the gamepad buttons and to copy out the video frame buffer. Audio from the SGB CPU was passed along two pins on the SNES cartridge connector to be mixed with the SNES audio output.


Market penetration

49 million Super NES units were sold worldwide, 20 million of which were sold in the US.
