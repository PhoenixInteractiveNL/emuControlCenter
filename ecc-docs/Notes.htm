<h2>Notes</h2>

<hr />

<h3>ZIP Parser</h3>

<p>MAME, Arcade and Dosbox files/roms only work when they are ZIPped.
These multiple packed files will use the ZIP parser and are NOT processed
when compressed with 7Zip or RAR.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Kameleon Code</h3>

<p>After entering the kameleon code you have to select the service again to make use of it.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Administrator rights</h3>

<p>If you don't have Admin rights on this machine you can expect READ-ONLY behavior with ECC!!</p>

<hr />

<h3>More instances of ECC running</h3>

<p>Running more then one instance of ECC at the same install location is NOT advisable!! your ECC database could be damaged!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Minimal width resolution of 1000 pixels</h3>

<p>Your useable WIDTH resolution to display ECC, should be more then 1000 pixels, otherwise you can expect GUI glitching or the GUI does not work at all ! (this may occur when you have set the taskbar on the side @ 1024x768)</p>

<hr />

<h3>Setting and using the ECC DATABASE path</h3>

<ul>
<li>With manual input always use a ending slash .</li>
<li>Network paths are not listed, but you can type them manually like: \COMPUTER\PATH.</li>
<li>Wrong pathnames or no rights to write will reset the DB tot he default "ecc-system\database" location.</li>
<li>When configuring a location of a existing ECC configuration/database, you have to copy the database manually to the new location.</li>
<li>You may experience slow response form ECC when you store the datbaase on a network path.</li>
<li>ECC is not tested to run from multiple computers with the same database, the database could be "in use by another application" let me know if it works!</li>
</ul>
