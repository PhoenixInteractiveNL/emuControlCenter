The APF Imagination Machine was a combination home video game console and computer system released by APF Electronics Inc. in late 1979. It was composed of two separate components, the APF-M1000 game system, and an add on docking bay with full sized typewriter keyboard and tape drive. The APF-M1000 was built specifically to compete with the Atari 2600. The Imagination Machine has the distinction of being one of, if not the first, affordable home PCs to connect to the television, and is still one of the most expandable consoles ever marketed. The full APF Imagination Machine, including the APF-M1000 console and the IM-1 computer component originally sold for around $700.

Special features
The APF Imagination Machine had a few stand out features for its time.


APF Basic
First and foremost, was the bundled APF Basic compiler, which would allow almost anyone to program their own games and programs. Most retailers of the system offered a full and hefty instruction manual to teach you how the specialized code worked, and most even offered a tech sheet that specified every function of every chip on the console, so as to allow the users to make the most efficient code possible. To encourage more home users to create their own games and trade them, a monthly mailing list was started that lasted well through the video game crash of '83 and into the era of the next generation of consoles.


Special cassette
Second, and often one of the most marketed features of the console, was the fact that it had a dual sided cassette drive, that would allow the user to not only write or use a game or program from it, but also either record their own voice to it or listen to prerecorded audio. The feature was generally used for programmers to leave notes of their work, or for instructions to be read aloud before a game was played.


Peripherals
Third, the console had an unprecedented number of aftermarket add-ons, which included:

RS232 Storage Cartridge 
Floppy Disk Storage 
8k RAM Cartridge 
Mini Floppy Disk Storage 
Telephone Modem 
As well as a hub of sorts, generally called the 'building block' which would allow for the connection of a good deal of standard computer accessories.
