Originally, Yamaha and ASCII announced the V9978 Video Display Processor in 1990, the video chip for the MSX3. It was a very capable video IC, featuring two different sets of video modes. In bitmap modes it was capable of up to 768×240 resolution (up to 768×480 in interlace mode), up to 32768 colors, superimposing, hardware scrolling, and even a hardware cursor for Windows-like OSes. However the most impressive feature with these modes was the use of high-speed hardware bit block data mover. The MSX2 video IC was also equipped with a hardware bit mover, but the new one was going to be 20 times faster!

In pattern mode, it was capable of SNES class features. Multi layers, 16k patterns, several palettes, 128 sprites, a maximum of 16 sprites per scanline. So basicly a SNES but with no mode7.

However, something went wrong and the project was canceled. Probably due to the lack of interest in marketing of MSX machines and growing interest in game consoles and powerful PC alike computers (for word processing purposes mainly), companies were not so enthusiastic about creating a new MSX machine anymore. The biggest software supporters of MSX deserted to Nintendo and other computers/game machines. Sony chose to make their own game console.

We ended getting the MSXturboR instead, a supercharged MSX2+. Some people say ASCII wasn't able to delivery the new VDP in time for the 1990 release, so they ended going with just the new CPU (named R800). However the V9978 specs and pinout were featured in some databooks from that time. Later Yamaha and ASCII removed the legacy compatibility features in the V9978 and released it as the V9990, which was later used in the GFX9000 hobby project. (See also below.)

So, the result is two excellent MSX2++ machines, released by Panasonic. And after that, it ended, as Panasonic moved on to their 3DO game console.

Specs:
    *  Mainly the same as the FS-A1ST. Due to some minor bugs that were discovered, the mainboard is a bit different: e.g. MSX-Music part is redesigned to decrease influence of the noise from computer's digital parts.
    * MSX-BASIC V4.1 (MIDI extensions)
    * 512kB of main RAM
    * MSX-MIDI interface built in (Not the same as MIDI-Saurus, thus available as a cartridge from BIT² for MSX2 and up). Includes 8251 (UART) and 8254 (timer)
    * 16kB MIDI-BASIC ROM (almost same as FM-BASIC which is built in in the FM-PAC and the MSX2+ machines with MSX-Music)
    * MIDI in/out connectors
    * MSX-VIEW (`MSX-Windows') developed by ASCII & HAL. Software as Page Edit, PageView, Page Link, VShell, VTed, VPaint and VDraw) on 512kB ROM DISK (C: drive).
    * MSX-DOS V2.31
    * 32kB SRAM for backup (some games can use it)/SRAM disk (D: drive)
    * SVHS connector
    * Sold with the game Seed of Dragon
