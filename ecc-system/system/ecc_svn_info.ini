The Watara Supervision is a monochrome handheld game console, originating from Hong Kong, and introduced in 1992 as a cut-price competitor for Nintendo's Game Boy. It came packaged with a game called Crystball, which is similar to Breakout.

The console has a slightly larger screen and larger buttons, and its games sold for far less than the Game Boy's. The games were simpler than the Game Boy's, and the console did not sell well. The original design for the console changed significantly through several iterations, and the last Supervisions were sold in 1996.

The Supervision was marketed by several different companies around the world and under several different names, including Quickshot Supervision, Travell Mate, and Hartung SV-100.
It was so popular in the early 1990s that it was once offered as a final prize in the extremely popular television show Legends of the Hidden Temple.
