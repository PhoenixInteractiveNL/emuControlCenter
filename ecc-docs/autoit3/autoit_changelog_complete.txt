- Changed: (Internal) FPU assembler used for advanced math (sin,cos,pow, etc) functions due to
         exe size problems under VC7



3.0.85 (9th Jan, 2004)
- Added: HotKeySet()
- Added: Abs(), Sin(), Cos(), Tan(), ASin(), ACos(), ATan(), Sqrt(), Log(), Exp()
- Added: ^ operator
- Added: Round()
- Added: Call()
- Changed: IniWrite/IniDelete() return 0 if they fail

- Added: New window WinTitleMatchMode of 3 (for exact title match)
- Added: Some more details added to helpfile
- Changed: The key # is no longer used as a delimiter but as a left Win key combination.  So
           Send("#e") now presses the left win+e keys.  I don't think anyone actually used
           it as a delimiter anyway - it was just a left over from v1 and it never made 
           lines easier to read anyway
- Changed: FileReadLine() and FileWriteLine() modified so that they optionally accept a filename
           instead of a filehandle for "quick 'n' dirty" file access - I'm sure this will be
           popular :)



3.0.83 (30th Dec, 2003)
- Changed: Due to popular demand, by default functions now return 0 for error and 1 for success.  
           This affects the following functions: FileWriteLine, CDTray, DriveSetLabel, DirCreate, 
           DirRemove, FileCopy, FileMove, FileDelete, FileInstall, ClipPut, URLDownloadToFile, 
           RunAsSet, Shutdown, RegWrite, RegDelete, WinWait, WinWaitActive, WinWaitClose, WinWaitNotActive,
           ProcessWait, ProcessWaitClose.  If you were using the return values of one of 
           these functions then please check your scripts.

- Changed: ControlSend() supports {} (for most things at least...)
