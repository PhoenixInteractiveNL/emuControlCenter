The Nintendo Entertainment System (called Famicom in Japan) was an instant hit with such popular titles as Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda and Excitebike.

It was released to the states in August, 1985. The 8-bit graphics were far superior to any-home based console that had come before it. Strong sales were were driven by the gamers wanting the feeling of real-life arcade games in their homes.

The NES boasts an impressive library of games with over 8000 games (Cowering goodnes), offering a smorgasbord of titles for fans of every genre. The Nintendo continued it's reign with other big hits such as The Mega Man series, Ninja Gaiden, Contra, Castlevania, Double Dragon and of course, Super Mario Bros 3.  The NES continued it's strong sales with over 36 million units sold worldwide by its official cancellation in January 1996 but not before releasing a redesigned NES.
