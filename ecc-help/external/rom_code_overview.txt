.............: STANDARD CODE NOTES ::............
:                                               :\
: [a] This is simply an alternate version of a  :\
:     ROM. Many games have been re-released to  :\
:     fix bugs or even to eliminate Game Genie  :\
:     codes (Yes, Nintendo hates that device).  :\
:             -------------------               :\
: [b] A bad dump often occurs with an older     :\
:     game or a faulty dumper (bad connection). :\
:     Another common source of [b] ROMs is a    :\
:     corrupted upload to a release FTP.        :\
:             -------------------               :\
: [f] A fixed game has been altered in some way :\
:     so that it will run better on a copier    :\
:     or emulator.                              :\
:             -------------------               :\
: [h] Something in this ROM is not quite as it  :\
:     should be. Often a hacked ROM simply has  :\
:     a changed header or has been enabled to   :\
:     run in different regions. Other times it  :\
:     could be a release group intro, or just   :\
:     some kind of cheating or funny hack.      :\
:             -------------------               :\
: [o] An overdumped ROM image has more data     :\
:     than is actually in the cart. The extra   :\
:     information means nothing and is removed  :\
:     from the true image.                      :\
:             -------------------               :\
: [t] A trainer is special code which executes  :\
:     before the game is begun. It allows you   :\
:     to access cheats from a menu.             :\
:             -------------------               :\
: [!] Verified good dump. Thank God for these!  :\

: (BS) These Japanese ROMs were distributed     :\
:      through a satellite system in Japan      :\
:      known as the Broadcast Satellaview.      :\
:      They were transmitted along with a TV    :\
:      show which was connected to the game in  :\
:      some way. These games were only playable :\
:      during the show, and thus stop after an  :\
:      hour, and many were timed so that only   :\
:      certain time periods were playable.      :\
:             -------------------               :\
: (ST) The Sufami Turbo device allowed two      :\
:      GameBoy sized carts to be plugged into   :\
:      the SNES. Certain carts combined into    :\
:      new games much like the Sonic & Knuckles :\
:      lock-on technology by Sega.              :\
:             -------------------               :\
: (NP) Nintendo Power has been known to release :\
:      games only available to its subscribers. :\
:      Most of these ROMs are Japanese, as this :\
:      practice occured mainly in Japan.        :\

:  (1) Carts with this code will run on both    :\
:      Japanese and Korean machines.            :\
:             -------------------               :\
:  (4) While this code is technically the same  :\
:      as a (U) code, it is a newer header      :\
:      format and represents that the cart will :\
:      run on USA and Brazil NTSC machines.     :\
:             -------------------               :\
:  (B) This country code indicates that the     :\
:      cart will run on any non US machine.     :\
:             -------------------               :\
:  [c] This code represents a cart with known   :\
:      faulty checksum routines.                :\

: **** GameBoy ****                             :\
: [BF] Bung released a programmable cartridge   :\
:      compatable with the GameBoy which could  :\
:      hold any data you wished to play.        :\
:      However, many games do not function on   :\
:      Bung v1.0 carts and have to be 'fixed.'  :\
:             -------------------               :\

: PC10 The PlayChoice 10 was an arcade unit     :\
:      which played exact copies of NES games   :\
:      in an arcade cabinet. The machines had a :\
:      choice of 10 games to choose from and    :\
:      ran for about 3 minutes on 25 cents.     :\
:             -------------------               :\
