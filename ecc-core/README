== Gnope PHP-Gtk2 Installer ==

The installer sets up a full-featured PHP-Gtk2 on your Windows computer.
It allows you to run, install and uninstall PHP-Gtk2 applications
by pointing and clicking - ready for the end user.

It contains the following packages:
- PHP 5.1.1 CLI version
- PHP-Gtk2 development version 2005-12-02
- PEAR 1.4.5
  - PEAR_Frontend_Gtk2 0.0.5
  - Gnope_AppRunner 0.0.7
  - Dev_Inspector 0.0.5
  - Gtk2_VarDump 0.0.4
- Gtk2 2.6.9
- GTK-Wimp 0.7.0


ATTENTION: PHP-Gtk2 is in its alpha stage. It might crash
at any given time, but works well enough to run some programs.
You have been warned.

= Thanks =

I want to thank the following people for making that program possible:
- Andrei Zmievski     for creating PHP-Gtk
- Steph Fox           for making the windows build system
- Tom Rogers          for actually compiling the files
- Greg Beaver         for making the PEAR installer and uncountable helping emails


= Versioning =

You might wonder about the version 1.x, because there is
alpha-quality software in here. I decided that 1.x is the branch
containing development versions of PHP-Gtk2, while version 2.0 will
contain the first official stable version of PHP-Gtk2.
