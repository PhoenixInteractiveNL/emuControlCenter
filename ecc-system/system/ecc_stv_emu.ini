[emu:ssf]
name=SSF
Notes=SSF is a Windows-based emulator of the Sega Saturn and Sega Titan Video (ST-V, an arcade board very similar to the Saturn). Despite the historical difficulty of emulating the Saturn's rather idiosyncratic and complex architecture, and the fact that SSF is developed by a sole developer (Shima), it has overtaken other Saturn emulators to the point of being able to run the majority of games with few to no issues. It is designed to run game CDs directly, so images must be mounted with a virtual drive program (e.g. Daemon Tools) in order to be played.
