You can start with the "Classic" or "Wizard" interface.  It is easy to switch between the two interfaces, and you can always change the default later.
WinZip Classic is the more powerful of the two interfaces and is recommended if you are comfortable with Windows and Zip files. Most WinZip users choose this interface.
The WinZip Wizard automates the most common tasks involving Zip files and is most useful for users who are new to Windows and Zip files.
