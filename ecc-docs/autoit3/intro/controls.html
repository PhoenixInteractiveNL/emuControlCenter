<h1>Controls</h1>
<p>One of the best new features with AutoIt v3 is the ability to work directly 
  with certain types of Window <em>Controls</em>.&nbsp; Almost everything you 
  see on a window is a control of some kind: buttons, listboxes, edit fields, 
  static text are all controls.&nbsp; In fact Notepad is just one big &quot;Edit&quot; 
  control!&nbsp; Because AutoIt works directly with a control they provide a more 
  reliable way to automate than just sending keystrokes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>: AutoIt only works with standard Microsoft 
  controls - some applications write their own custom controls which may look 
  like a standard MS control but may resist automation. Experiment! </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the <a href="au3spy.html">AutoIt Window Info Tool </a> you can move your mouse 
  around the window you are interested in and you will be given information of 
  the control that is currently under your mouse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A special description can be used as the <strong>controlID</strong> parameter used in most of the <a href="../functions/ControlClick.html">Control...()</a> functions . This description can be used to identify a control by the following <em>properties</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ID - </strong>The internal control ID. The Control ID is the internal numeric identifier that windows gives to each control. It is generally the best method of 
identifying controls. In addition to the AutoIt Window Info Tool, other applications such as screenreaders for the blind and Microsoft tools/APIs may allow you to get this Control ID</li>
  <li><strong>TEXT - </strong>The text on a control, for example &quot;&amp;Next&quot; on a button </li>
  <li><strong>CLASS - </strong>The internal control classname such as &quot;Edit&quot; or &quot;Button&quot; </li>
  <li><strong>INSTANCE - </strong>The 1-based instance when all given properties match</li>
  <li><strong>CLASSNN -</strong> The ClassnameNN value as used in previous versions of AutoIt, such as &quot;Edit1&quot; </li>
</ul>
<p>One or more  properties are used in the<em> controlID </em>parameter of a control command in the format:</p>
<p class="codebox"> [PROPERTY1:Value1; PROPERTY2:Value2]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If this special format is <strong>not</strong> used then the parameter is taken to be a control ID (if numeric) or the ClassnameNN/text of the control (if a string). Although the special format is more longwinded than these methods it is much less ambiguous. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e.g. Send text to the 1st Edit control in the Notepad window </p>
<p class="codebox"> ControlSend(&quot;Untitled - Notepad&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;[CLASS:Edit; INSTANCE:1]&quot;, &quot;This is some text&quot;)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p class="codebox"> ControlSend(&quot;Untitled - Notepad&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;[CLASSNN:Edit1]&quot;, &quot;This is some text&quot;)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p class="codebox"> ControlSend(&quot;Untitled - Notepad&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Edit1&quot;, &quot;This is some text&quot;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e.g. Click on control ID 254 in &quot;My Window&quot; </p>
<p class="codebox"> ControlClick(&quot;My Window&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;[ID:254]&quot;)</p>
<p>or  </p>
<p class="codebox">ControlClick(&quot;My Window&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 254)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e.g. Click  the 2nd instance of a &quot;Button&quot; control containing the text &quot;Finish&quot; </p>
<p class="codebox">ControlClick(&quot;My Window&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;[CLASS:Button; TEXT:Finish; INSTANCE:2]&quot;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Control Handle (HWND) </h2>
<p>Using the <a href="../functions/ControlGetHandle.html">ControlGetHandle</a> function you can determine the <em>Handle</em> or <em>HWND</em> of a control. A handle is the unique identifier that Windows gives controls. The handle changes <em>each time the control is created</em>. This method of accessing controls is generally only designed for users who are familar with working with handles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look under the contents for <strong><a href="../functions/ControlCommand.html">Function 
  Reference \ Window Management \ Controls</a></strong> for a list of the functions 
  that work with controls.</p>
