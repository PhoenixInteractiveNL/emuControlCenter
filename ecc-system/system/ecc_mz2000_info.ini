The Sharp MZ is a series of personal computers sold in Japan and Europe (particularly Germany and Great Britain) by Sharp beginning in 1978.

Although commonly believed to stand for 'Microcomputer Z80', the term MZ actually has its roots in the MZ-40K, a home computer kit produced by Sharp in 1980. This was soon followed by the MZ-80K, K2, C, and K2E, all of which were based on Fujitsu's 4-bit MB8843 processor and provided a simple hexadecimal keypad for input. (The MZ-80C, which was sold fully assembled, included a full alphanumeric keyboard.)

From the first Z80 processor-based model to the MZ-2200 in 1983, the MZ computers included the PC, monitor, keyboard, and tape-based recorder in a single unit, similar to Commodore's PET series. It was also notable for not including a programming language or operating system in ROM, like the IBM PC. This allowed a host of third-party companies, starting with Hudson Soft, to produce many languages and OSes for the system. In an era when floppy disk drives were too expensive for most home users, the MZ's built-in tape drive was considered faster and more reliable than the drive on competing computers; however, this meant that the MZ series was relatively slow to adopt floppy drives as a standard accessory.
