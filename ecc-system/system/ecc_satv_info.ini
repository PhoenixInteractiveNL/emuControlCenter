The Satellaview (Japanese: ?????? Hepburn: Saterabyu) is a satellite modem peripheral for Nintendo's Super Famicom system that was released in Japan in 1995.[1] Available for pre-release orders beginning February 13, 1995, the Satellaview retailed for between ¥14,000[2] and 18,000[3][4] (at the time between USD$141 and 182) and came bundled with the BS-X Game Pak and an 8M Memory Pak.

The Satellaview system was developed and released by Nintendo to receive signals broadcast from satellite TV station WOWOW's satellite radio subsidiary, St.GIGA. St.GIGA was responsible for file server management, maintenance, and vocalization for 'SoundLink' games. Nintendo data broadcasts were given a fixed time slot known as the Super Famicom Hour (????????????) during which scrambled Satellaview-related data was streamed via radio waves to be unscrambled by St.GIGA's 'BS digital hi-vision TV' (BS????????????? BS Dejitaru HaiBijon Terebi). As a subscription-based station for ambient and New-age music, St.GIGA listeners were already equipped with 'BS tuners' prior to St.GIGA's contract with Nintendo. Satellaview owners who lacked a 'BS tuner' had to purchase one separately from St.GIGA at a price of ¥33,000,[5] as well as sign up for Nintendo's and St.GIGA's monthly joint membership fees.[6] Alternatively, users could rent 'BS tuners' from St.GIGA for a 6-month period at a price of ¥5,400.[5] Even at this premium price, St.GIGA reported subscriptions peaking at 116,378 households by March 1997, and dropping to around 46,000 by June 2001.[7]

Name
The name Satellaview is a portmanteau of 'Satellite' and 'view'. 'BS' stands for Broadcast Satellite, a common name of one of the direct broadcast satellites in Japan.[8]

Because the Satellaview was only released in Japan, there has been some confusion among English-speaking enthusiasts as to what the 'BS' prefix means. As a result, a number of mistranslations have been introduced into common use today and are prevalent on English-speaking fan sites, most commonly either 'Bandai Satellaview'[9] or 'Broadcast Satellaview'. Another common mistake that can be found on English-speaking fan sites is the application of the 'BS' prefix to all Satellaview titles. While it is true that a number of Satellaview titles do employ the 'BS' prefix, the majority of them do not.[10] The most standard method used to title Satellaview games used three formats for three different purposes:

The 'BS' prefix was only used for the Satellaview's SoundLink Games (e.g. BS Zelda no Densetsu). All 'BS-' titles are SoundLink games, but not all SoundLink games bear the 'BS' prefix.
The 'BS version' (?BS?? 'BS-ban') suffix was used solely for non-SoundLink Satellaview-original releases (e.g. Dezaemon BS Version (?????BS? Dezaemon BS-ban)). Although all 'BS Version' games are Satellaview originals, not all Satellaview originals bore the 'BS Version' suffix.
The original title was used for Satellaview ports and conversions (e.g. Zelda no Densetsu Kamigami no Triforce).
A fourth variety of title using the 'Satella-' (?????) prefix is common for Satellaview games, such as SatellaWalker (????????). These games are Satellaview originals that often take the form of Satellaview-themed quiz games or that relate to the world of the BS-X BIOS, BS-X: The Story of The Town Whose Name Was Stolen.
As the Broadcast Satellite (BS) system was in use in Japan prior to the release of the Satellaview; the term 'BS' may refer to programming prior to the Satellaview.

Hardware
The basic Satellaview system comprises this:
Satellaview adapter (SHVC-029), attached to the bottom of Super Famicom and plugged into the (previously unused) expansion port.
L-shaped bracket (SHVC-033), supplied power to the Super Famicom via the Satellaview.
AC Adapter (SHVC-032), an AC power cord.
AV Selector (SHVC-030), the Audio-visual Selector.
Application cartridge, BS-X : The Story of The Town Whose Name Was Stolen (BS-X ?????????????? BS-X: Sore wa Namae o Nusumareta Machi no Monogatari) (SHVC-028), plugs into the cartridge slot on top of the Super Famicom to provide the menu system for the downloading of broadcasts and the playing of games. (See below).
8M Memory Pak (SHVC-031), plugs into the BS-X application cartridge allowing players to save game data and other data. Memory paks are rewritable and can be used in conjunction with a handful of other compatible application cartridges. The basic Satellaview set came with a number of rewritable blank labels which could be applied to 8M Memory Paks to allow players to record the name of the data files they had recorded.
The deluxe system contains all the above as well as a rewritable 8-Megabit Memory Pak. The Satellaview base unit contains approximately 512 KB of memory of its own; however, the deluxe Memory Pak is required for larger games and to allow the player to have multiple saved games. Memory Paks were sold separately as well, and today these Memory Paks serve as a primary source of data retrieval for members of the subculture of collectors and enthusiasts devoted to the restoration of these games via emulation.[11]
