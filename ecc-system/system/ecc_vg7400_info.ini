description = "
The Philips Videopac + G7400 was a video game console released in limited quantities in 1983, and only in Europe; an American release as the Odyssey³ Command Center was planned but never occurred. The G7400 was the successor to the Philips Videopac G7000, the European counterpart to the American Magnavox Odyssey². The system had 16 KB of both RAM and ROM and featured excellently tailored background and foreground graphics

The Videopac+ supported three types of cartridges:

    * Original Videopac cartridges
    * Remakes of Videopac games which featured better graphics when played on a Videopac+, and standard graphics when played on a Videopac.
    * New Videopac+ exclusive games.
