description = "Technically the Laser 350 / 500 / 700 / 750 are completely different from the Laser 100 / 200 / 300 family and thus non compatible with them.

All 4 computers are nearly identical but the Laser 350 uses a Laser 300 case while the Laser 500 / 700 / 750 use a 'new' case.

Though the CPU is still a Z80A compatible one (the D780c from NEC), its capabilities are better.

There are now 6 graphical modes, ranging from 160 x 96 in 16 colors to 640 x 192 in 2 colors. The memory size is also bigger compared to the old series and ranges from 16K RAM for the Laser 350, to 128K RAM for the Laser 750. The Laser 500 and 700 have 64K.
