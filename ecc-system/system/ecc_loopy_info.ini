description = "The Casio Loopy, subtitled My Seal Computer SV-100, is a 32-bit games console sold exclusively in Japan. Released in October 1995, It was unique in that the marketing for it was completely targeted to the female market. Only 10 games were released for it, most being in the GxB and dress-up genres. A very interesting feature of this machine was that it included a built-in thermal color printer that could be used to create stickers from game screenshots. An optional accessory, called Magical Shop, allowed the machine to be used with outside devices (such as VCRs and DVD players) to obtain images from them, add text, and make stickers from those as well. The machine features only one controller port.
