The Genesis (called Megadrive in Japan) console featured many great conversions that banked on the success of Segas Arcade games. Games like Altered Beast, After Burner, Ghouls 'N Ghosts and Sonic the Hedgehog helped make this 16-bit system very popular.

Unfortunately third party support was difficult considering many developers were making games exclusively for the Nintendo systems. The Genesis was redesigned into a smaller and more affordable package three times.

There was also a portable version of the Genesis, called the Nomad, which featured a backlit LCD. The Genesis also served as the core for the expansion hardware with Sega CD and 32X that added CD support and additional
features.
