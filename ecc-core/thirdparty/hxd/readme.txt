Features
========
- Data inspector
  - interprets bytes at the current caret position into various datatypes: 
    - binary (bit sequence), integer, floats, time and date, character, GUID and disassembly (x86 and AMD64)
- Instant opening regardless of file-size
  (>4GB is no problem, if it fits on a disk/drive you can open it)
- Files opened in HxD are shared liberally but safely with other applications
  - minimal locking with caching to release the file whenever possible
- Fast searching: forward, backwards or from beginning
  - various datatypes: text, hex values, integer, floating point
  - text search supports UTF-16 Little Endian
  - search all option
- Replace function (fast even for millions of edits)
- Disk editor: RAW reading and writing of disks and drives
  - useful information like hardware id, size, or drive type for unambigious disk selection
  - automatic unmounting of relevant filesystems when saving, to grant access to many usually locked drives
- RAM editor/virtual memory editor: can read and write virtual memory of other processes
  - for 32 and 64 bit processes
  - Memory open window shows (and can sort by) PID, process name, and bitness
- Data-folding for better overview in RAM editor/virtual memory editor
- Splitting and joining files
- Safe deletion of files (shredder)
- File compare (simple version for now)
- Inserting bytes or filling a selection with a pattern
- Grouping of bytes
- Only text or only hex mode

- Alternating colors for hex columns (configurable)
- Internet update checker

FAQ
===
Q: How do I make a feature request?
A: Mail me your ideas and also don't forget to tell me the benefits.
   You may also post them in the forum: http://forum.mh-nexus.de

Q: I found a bug. How should I report it?
A: Please use the "Bugs"-section in the support-forum: http://forum.mh-nexus.de
   Try to give as many details as possible, especially describe the necessary
   steps to reproduce the bug.
   
Q: I would like to translate HxD. What should I do?
A: Translations are very welcome! Please contact me and I will send you the
   necessary language files and the translation program.

Q: The RAM-Editor shows many ? (question marks), what do they mean?
A: Question marks represent inaccessible sections of the virtual memory.
   This happens either because this memory-section is not allocated or
   it is protected. Programs usually only use a small amount of the 4 GB range
   they could use. The data-folding feature should help you to navigate: it
   hides all inaccessible memory-sections by default.

Q: Why does the TeX-Exporter sometimes produce output containing errors?
A: It is very hard to tell LaTeX to set all characters of the Windows 1252
   charset as it should. I tried to fix some issues, but there are still
   characters that do not work. If you have any deeper knowledge on this,
   feel free to contact me.

Q: Will there be more printing options?
A: This depends on how much interest there is.
   If you want more features, mail me.
