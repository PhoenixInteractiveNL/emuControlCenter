The Atari Video Computer System (VCS) was released in 1977 at a suggested retail price of $299, which dropped quickly as sales soared; about 340,000 systems were sold the first year alone.

Joe Decuir, Steve Mayer and Ron Milner designed the VCS. The Atari VCS was developed under the project codename 'Stella'.  The VCS later became known, both commonly and officially as the Atari 2600 (from the model number CX2600).

It is rumored that the number 2600 was chosen because 2600 cycles was a prominent long distance access tone, and that one of the developers had created devices that would trick pay phones into granting long distance access as a hobby.
