[emu:aes4all]
name=AES4ALL
Notes=AES4ALL is a SNK Neo Geo AES and MVS emulator. NOTE: To use AES4ALL (NEO4ALL/AES), you need to convert typical ZIP-compressed NEOGEO roms. The 'convertneo' command-line tool allows this conversion of supported games. First, put all files of NEOGEO bios (uncompress neogeo.zip of MAME) and 'aes-bios.bin' file of NEOGEO home to bios directory. Then, go to Windows CMD and execute 'convertneo.exe' with filename of ZIP as parameter, for example: C:\temp\convertneo> convertneo.exe migame.zip - If all are ok you will have a 'migame.aes' file for playing with AES4ALL.

[emu:calice]
name=Calice32
Notes=Calice is an emulator that is capable of playing almost all SNK Neo Geo ROMs plus, Sony ZiNc ZN1 and ZN2, Capcom CPS1 and CPS2 and all Sega System 16/18 ROMs. One of its cons is that it lacks image enhancements that Kawaks and Nebula have. It also requires that you run your desktop in 16 bit color rather than 32 bit.
