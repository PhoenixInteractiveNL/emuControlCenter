The EACA EG2000 Colour Genie was a computer produced by Hong Kong-based manufacturer EACA. It followed their earlier Video Genie I and II computers (and was released around the same time as the business-oriented Video Genie III). However, it was not compatible with them.
Unlike the earlier Video Genies, which were compatible with their main competitor (the Model I TRS-80), the Colour Genie was also incompatible with the rival TRS-80 Color Computer — one fundamental difference being the different CPUs.
