Welcome to ECC!, this is the first time you run ECC.

NOTES:

- After you press the 'OK' button, ECC is going to create 'userfolders'
and will generate 'media' images, this can take a while...
Also make sure you have at least 50MB of free space!

- Administrator rights:
If you don't have Admin rights on this machine you can expect
READ-ONLY behavior with ECC!!

- Minimal width resolution of 1000 pixels:
Your useable WIDTH resolution to display ECC, should be more then
1000 pixels, otherwise you can expect GUI glitching or the GUI
does not work at all !
(this may occur when you have set the taskbar on the side @ 1024x768)
