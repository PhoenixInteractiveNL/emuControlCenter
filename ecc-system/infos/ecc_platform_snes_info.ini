Nintendo released the cartridge based 16-bit Super Nintendo to compete with the already released Sega Genesis and NEC's TurboGraphix 16 (PCEngine in Japan). The Super Nintendo features true stereo sound, multiple scrolling backgrounds and increased internal memory. It was a very popular system because people could play continuations of their favorite NES game. The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past, The Donkey Kong Country Series, The Final Fantasy Series and Super Mario Kart were a few of the top titles for the SNES. In 1997 Nintendo redesigned the case, but never included a CD-ROM expansion.
