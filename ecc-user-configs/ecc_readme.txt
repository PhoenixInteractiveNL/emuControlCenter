- This is the emuControlCenter userfolder for configs!
- You can get the latest version of ecc at http://www.camya.com/
- With ecc, you can manage your roms in an easier way!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains configs for the emuControlCenter platforms.
Everytime, you save a config within emuControlCenter a version of the original ini is copied to this folder. This ensure, that an update of emuControlCenter does not overwrite your configurations.

This can cause problems if there are changes within the oringila ini files. (You get no new platforms :-)) This will be fixed by an inteligent update (ini-merge) mechanism implemented in one of the next ecc-version! :-)
