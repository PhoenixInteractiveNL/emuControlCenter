Overclocking ability is random, however all GP32s are supposed to reach 133 MHz. A few early "bad" units maxed out at 132 MHz.)

- Power Supply 2 x AA batteries or 3-V DC adapter. Batteries last between 6 and 12+ hours, but actual amount depends on a number of factors. 




Description

The console is based on a 133 MHz ARM CPU, which can be overclocked to 166 MHz through software. This is backed by eight megabytes of RAM (upgradeable to 32/64 MB). Unlike similar gaming systems, which are proprietary cartridge-based, the GP32 uses rewritable SmartMedia cards, making it very appealing for amateur game developers. The console also has a USB port for connection with a PC, and a serial expansion port.

There are three main commercial versions of the unit: the original GP32, with no light, the front-lit unit (FLU), modified for Game Park by Hahotech, and the back-lit unit (BLU), released in Europe in mid-summer 2004. At the end of 2004, Game Park also released so-called BLU+ versions, which have a different screen than the normal BLU units. All commercially released units are white with grey or white buttons. There are also a number of differently colored promotional units, and several prototype units with wildly different designs.


GP32 Features

DivX
The GP32 is natively capable of playing DivX movies. This sets it apart from its rival product, the Game Boy Advance, which requires a third-party upgrade for this feature. The GP32 plays media files more fluently than Nintendo's console.


Software Installation
The GP32 stores its software on SmartMedia cards varying in sizes from 2MB to 128MB. This allows the user to store custom media, applications and games on his GP32, including alternative firmware. Commercial games can be acquired via internet download or in a retail box. The box contains a game CD, which is placed in your PC, so that the software can be transferred to the GP32 system's SmartMedia card via USB cable. This method effectively reduced the price of the games because you weren't paying for cartridges (though you still had to pay for high priced SmartMedia cards to store the games later on). Downloading a game online could range from Dollar10 to Dollar30.


Homebrew Friendly
Game Park planned their system to be powerful and useful, but they also wanted users to be able to create homebrew software (a first in video game consoles). When one bought a GP32, one could register the unit on the official website and get a free suite of development tools to create their own games and applications for the GP32. Game Park also allowed (under certain restrictions) the publishing of such homebrew games on their website.

Through this strategy, the GP32 was the host of multiple homebrew applications and games. The various applications made for it ranged from alternative firmware (GUI), games, game generators (such as RPG maker), DivX players, image slideshows, and emulators.


Emulators
The GP32 has the processing power, and is easy enough to program for that many emulators have been developed for the system. Emulators of many popular 16-bit and earlier consoles are available, as well as of some older computer platforms. Those allowed gamers to play a large variety of older games on their GP32 systems. There is also a Windows-based emulator for GP32, which allows users to run GP32 software on a Windows-based PC.


Games
Although the number of official games available for the GP32 system is limited, many open source/free software developers are working on various emulators and are porting PC games. In addition to this, a wide range of free, public-domain games are being created by amateur developers. Game Park does not ask any royalties to release games for its device, which makes it easier for small editors or independent developers to release software for the GP32.

The modification of Ericsson Chatboard micro-keyboards to work with the system has seen a new flourish of software development, including countless attempts at ports of Linux, and keyboard support being added to many emulators.


Commercial availability
Commercially, the system can be found mostly in Korea, and some other parts of Asia, although the GP32 BLU model was released in three European markets, including Portugal, Spain, and Italy on June 15, 2004 with a price point of €199. There are official distributors in the United Kingdom and Sweden as well. Game Park, however, does not intend to release the console in America.

Despite of the GP32 not being released worldwide, it has a large international community of users and developers
