name=Sega Model 2 Emulator
Notes=Model 2 Emulator is a SEGA Model 2, 2A, 2B and 2C emulator. NOTE: To bypass the 'Network Board Not Present' message you need to set the 'Link ID' to 'Single'. To do this, enter Test Mode ('F2'), then select 'Game System' ('z' moves down, 'c' moves up, '1' selects) and select 'Single' in 'Link ID'. Finally, exit out of Test Mode and everything should work.
