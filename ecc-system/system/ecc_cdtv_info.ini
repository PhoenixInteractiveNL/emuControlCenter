The Commodore CDTV (for Commodore Dynamic Total Vision) was a computer made by Commodore International and launched in March 1991. It was one of the first computers to come with a CD-ROM drive as standard. The CDTV was designed and marketed as a set-top box to go along with one's VCR and be used as a CD-player and games console. It was created as a direct competitor to the CD-i, with neither having any real commercial success. Though the CDTV was based entirely on Amiga hardware it was marketed as Commodore CDTV with the Amiga name omitted from product branding.

The CDTV was essentially an Amiga 500, replacing the floppy drive with a single-speed CD-ROM drive. But unlike its progenitor, CDTV was intended as a media appliance rather than a personal computer. As such, its housing had dimensions and styling compatible with most stereo components, and came with an infrared remote control. Similarly, it was initially sold without keyboard and mouse (which could be added separately). Commodore chose Amiga enthusiast magazines as its chief advertising channel, but the Amiga community on the whole avoided the CDTV in the expectation of an add-on CD-ROM drive for the Amiga, which eventually came in the form of the A570.

The CDTV was supplied with the already obsolete AmigaOS 1.3, rather than the more advanced 2.0 release. The CDXL motion video format was primarily developed for the CDTV making it one of the earliest consumer systems to allow video playback from CD-ROM.

The CDTV debuted in America in March 1991 (CES, Las Vegas) and in the UK (Word of Commodore 1991 at Earls Court, London)[1]. It was advertised at £499 for the CDTV unit, remote control and two titles[2]. Though Commodore later developed an improved and cost-reduced CDTV-II[3] it was never released and the CDTV was eventually replaced with the Amiga CD32 following its release in 1993.
