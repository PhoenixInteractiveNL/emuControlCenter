emuControlCenter (ecc) is a tool to managing and searching rom-files of various platforms. It has the ability to edit meta-data, could handle screenshots and have many search and limit functionalities.

ecc is not an emulator, but could start media from his gui in assigned emulators.

Start of developing of ecc was in late november 2005, using python as programming-language. This attemp was canceled in late december 2005. In may 2006, ecc was written from the scratch in PHP-GTK2 to take a look, if PHP-GTK2 is useable for this kind of project. In late October 2006, the first public beta of emuControlCenter will arrive.

To be continued... :-)
