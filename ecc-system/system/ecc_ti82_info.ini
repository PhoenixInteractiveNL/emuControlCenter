The TI-82 is powered by the same processor that powered its cousin, the TI-85, a 6 MHz Zilog Z80 microprocessor. This was an improvement over the TI-81's 2 MHz Z80 processor. In addition, the available RAM was increased more than tenfold — from 2.4 KB to 28 KB (the same amount as the TI-85).

Some of the more notable improvements of the TI-82 over the TI-81 include the following: the addition of a link port to enable programs and other data to be transferred between two calculators or between a calculator and a computer; the addition of two new graphing types—polar and sequence, the addition of a new type of data — the list, the expansion of the size limit of matrices to 50x50, and the (unintentional) addition of the ability to program the calculator in assembly language. The last of these provided a significant boost in interest in the programmability of the calculator, as the use of assembly language (as opposed to Texas Instruments' own TI-BASIC) enabled significantly more performance and flexibility with the programs able to be used on the calculator.

Carried over from the TI-81 is the TI-82's power source — four AAA batteries and one CR1616 or CR1620 lithium backup battery (to ensure programs are kept when the AAA batteries are being changed).
