The Neo Geo CD was released shortly after its cartridge-based equivalent in an effort to reduce manufacturing costs. The system was originally priced at USDollar300 new. The unit's 1X CD-ROM drive was quite slow, making loading times very long with the system loading up to 56 Mbit of data between loads. Neo Geo CD game prices were lowered to a reasonable Dollar50 as opposed to the usual cost for MVS game cartridges, sometimes upwards of Dollar300. The system could be used to play Audio CDs.

The Neo Geo CD comes with a control pad instead of the joystick that is in other Neo Geo systems. This made the controls more stiff and caused some difficulty in play if one was used to the joystick.

Ultimately, the Neo Geo CD was considered poor, mainly because of the lack of marketing and the long load times.


Models
A total of three versions of the Neo Geo CD have been released:

A front-loading device (only distributed in Japan, 25000 total units were built) 
A top loading version that was marketed worldwide (the most common model) 
The CDZ. 


CDZ
The CDZ was released in 1996 as the Japanese market replacement for SNK's previous effort, the Neo Geo CD. The NGCD had met with limited success because it was plagued by slow loading times that could vary from 30 to 60 seconds between levels, depending on the game. Although SNK's American home entertainment division quickly acknowledged that the system simply wasn't capable of competing with 3D-capable powerhouse systems of the day like Sega's Saturn and Sony's PlayStation, SNK corporate of Japan felt that they could continue to maintain profitable sales in the Japanese home market by shortening the previous system's load-times.

Popular rumor suggests that SNK made several changes to the CD hardware to end up with the CDZ, most prominent is the rumor that they increased the CD-ROM drive speed from 1x to 2x. The truth of the matter is that the CDZ had a larger amount of cache. Though the CD-Rom motor in the CDZ may have been more efficient than the one in the original, it was still a 1x speed CD-Rom. The console had a design flaw that sometimes caused it to overheat after certain periods of time, breaking the console in the process and making it hard to repair. This was a result of a lack of ventilation in the cramped housing of the smaller unit and more heat generated by the newer drive which could damage the circuit board.


CDZ Availability
The CDZ console was the third of three generations of CD system offered by SNK, the first two being the 'front-loader' CD system and the 'top-loader' CD system. Like the original 'front-loader' style CD system, the CDZ was officially sold only in Japan during its production. However its lack of a 'region lock' feature and the fact that it could play older CD software made it a popular import item for enthusiasts in Europe and North America. Today they can be found sporadically on the internet, especially through auction sites such as eBay.


Technical Specifications:
 
Neo Geo CD Boot LogoMain Processor: Motorola 68000 running at 12 MHz 
Although the 68000 CPU was designed by Motorola, there were many other clones of this CPU found in the Neo Geo hardware. The most common CPU is the TMP68HC000 manufactured by Toshiba. This is essentially a Motorola 68000 clone. 
Colors On Screen: 4,096 
Colors Available: 65,536 
Resolution: 304 x 224 
Max Sprites: 380 
Max Sprite Size: 16 x 512 
Number of Planes: 3 
The system was also capable of Redbook audio as seen in many of the game's soundtracks. This is possibly the only advantage the CD system had over the cartridge system apart from the cheaper storage medium.

In addition to the multi-AV port (exact same one as used on the Sega Genesis model 1) all NGCD models had straight up composite RCA A/V and S-Video out jacks right on the rear of the console therefore eliminating the need for proprietary cables. The S-Video out on the console is highly recommended to use over the standard composite video. S-Video out cannot be achieved on the original NeoGeo AES system without hardware modification.

The CD system's 58 Mbit / 7 MB of ram was split accordingly:

68000 Program Memory: 2 MB 
Fix Layer Memory: 128 kB 
Graphics Memory: 4 MB 
Sound Sample Memory: 1 MB 
Z80 Program Memory: 64 kB 
VRAM: 512Kb (For graphics attributes) 
SRAM: 2 kB (For high scores / general save data)
