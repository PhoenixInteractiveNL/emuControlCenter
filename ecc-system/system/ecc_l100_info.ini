description = "The Laser 100/110 was the first model of the Laser 100/{200}/{300} family.

The ROM was nearly identical to the one of the Tandy Radio-Shack {TRS-80 Color Computer}, with only minor changes. It's so close that when people write Laser emulators, they use TRS-80 CoCo ROM documentations (Laser detailed documentations are hard to find, especially about the ROM itslef).

The Basic was a Microsoft Basic just slightly modified to avoid lawsuits, some statements being stored in the ROM but not available on the machine! 

Like the most of the Vtech products, the Laser 100/110 was 'cheaply' conceived: chicklet keyboard, plastic case, light-weight... It was produced to compete against the first wave of micro-computers like the famous Sinclair {ZX-81}. 

The difference between the Laser 100 and the Laser 110 must be the RAM size (like the {Laser 200 and 210}), though very little information on the Laser 100 is available. 

The biggest difference with its big brother the Laser {200} was that it only had a black & white display. 

An obscure VZ-100 version was also released but this wasn't the same machine as the VZ series sold in Australia and New-Zealand by Dick Smith Electronics.
