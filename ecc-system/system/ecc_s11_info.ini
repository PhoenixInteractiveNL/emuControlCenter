The Namco System 11 is an arcade system board released by Namco in 1994. The actual hardware is based on the Sony PlayStation, and thus many games were ported to that console. The major difference between the two is that the System 11 used surface-mounted ROM chips to store the game data, whereas the Playstation used CDs. This meant that all System 11 games were unique to the particular system board, and could not be swapped out with another game.
