The Xbox 360 is the second video game console produced by Microsoft, and was developed in cooperation with IBM, ATI, and SiS. The integrated Xbox Live service allows players to compete online and download content such as arcade games, game demos, trailers, TV shows, and movies. The Xbox 360 is the successor to the Xbox, and competes with Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles.

The Xbox 360 was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12, 2005, with detailed launch and game information divulged later that month at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). The console sold out completely at release in all regions except in Japan,[3][4][5] and, as of September 30, 2008, 22 million units have been sold worldwide according to Microsoft.[1] The Xbox 360 is available in three configurations: the 'Arcade' console, the 'Pro or Premium' console, and the 'Elite' console, each with its own selection of accessories.

Overview

Development
Known during development as Xenon, Xbox 2, Xbox FS,[6] Xbox Next, or NextBox, the Xbox 360 was conceived in early 2003.[7] In February 2003, planning for the Xenon software platform began, and was headed by Microsoft's Vice President J Allard.[7] That month, Microsoft held an event for 400 developers in Bellevue, Washington, to recruit support for the system.[7] Also that month, Peter Moore, former president of Sega of America, joined Microsoft. On August 12, 2003, ATI signed on to produce the graphic processing unit for the new console, a deal which was publicly announced two days later.[8] The following month, IBM agreed to develop the triple-core CPU for the console.[7] Before the launch of the Xbox 360, several alpha development kits were spotted using Apple's Power Mac G5 hardware. This was due to the system's PowerPC 970 processor running the same PowerPC architecture that the Xbox 360 would eventually run under IBM's Xenon processor.


Launch
Main article: Xbox 360 launch
The Xbox 360 was released on November 22, 2005, in the United States and Canada; December 2, 2005, in Europe and December 10, 2005, in Japan. It was later launched in Mexico, Colombia, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Chile, India, Brazil, Poland, Czech Republic, and Russia. Microsoft has additionally announced official launches in: Hungary, Slovakia,[9] and the Philippines.[10][dead link] In its first year on the market, the system launched in 36 countries, more countries than any console has launched in a single year.[11]


Retail configurations
The Xbox 360 is available in three standard variants; the 'Xbox 360 Arcade', the 'Xbox 360 Pro', and the 'Xbox 360 Elite'.[12] A discontinued SKU, the 'Xbox 360 Core', was replaced by the 'Xbox 360 Arcade' in October 2007.[13] The 60 GB version of the Xbox 360 Premium was released on August 1, 2008.

At launch, the Xbox 360 was available in two configurations: the 'Xbox 360 Premium' package, priced at USDollar399 or GBPound 280 , and the 'Xbox 360 Core', priced at USDollar299 and GBPound 199. The original shipment of the Premium version included a cut-down version of the Media Remote as a promotion. The Elite package was launched later at USDollar479.

The Xbox 360 Core (discontinued)[14] was an entry level Xbox 360. The 'Core' is no longer produced, having been replaced by the Xbox 360 Arcade.[12] It was not originally available in Japan, but was later released on November 2, 2006.[15] The Core system came bundled with composite video cables, capable of only SDTV resolutions, but newer models with lot number 0728 or greater have an HDMI 1.2 output. The Core may output HD signals up to 1080p when connected to separately sold HDMI, Component, or VGA cables. It may also utilize a separately sold 20 or 120 GB hard drive. Unlike all other SKUs, it shipped with a wired version of the Xbox 360 controller, instead of the wireless version found in other SKUs. 

 
An Xbox 360 Arcade, photographed on store shelves before the console was officially announcedThe Xbox 360 Arcade[16] is the replacement for the 'Xbox 360 Core'.[17] It was publicly revealed (though it was available in stores far earlier)[16] by Microsoft's president of Entertainment Devices division Robbie Bach to the Financial Times on October 18, 2007,[18] and officially announced on October 22, 2007.[13] It includes a wireless controller, 256 MB memory unit, composite AV cable, HDMI 1.2 output, and 5 Xbox Live Arcade titles:[19] Boom Boom Rocket, Feeding Frenzy, Luxor 2, Pac-Man Championship Edition, and Uno on a single disk, which also includes a 'Welcome Video' and several game trailers/demos.[20] Holiday 2008 consoles are bundled with Sega Superstars Tennis.[21] 

The Xbox 360 Pro includes all the features of the Xbox 360 Core and includes a hybrid composite and component cable with optional optical out instead of a composite cable. The Xbox 360 also includes a detachable 20 GB Hard Disk Drive (now comes with a 60 GB HDD) to store downloaded content, provide compatibility with original Xbox games, and store game data. The included hard drive comes with game demos, video clips and a free Live Arcade game, Hexic HD. In July 2007, this version of the Xbox 360 began appearing with the Zephyr motherboard (the motherboard used in the Elite) which features HDMI 1.2 output and an improved GPU heatsink. Although the Pro package does include an HDMI 1.2 output, it does not come with HDMI 1.2 cables.[22][23] Starting at the end of September 2007, the newest systems were shipped with the new 'Falcon' motherboard. This motherboard includes the new 65-nm CPUs, making them quieter and cooler than the older systems.[24] On August 1, 2008, the 20 GB Premium Xbox 360 was discontinued and was replaced by a 60 GB HDD model at the same price. Holiday 2008 consoles are bundled with Lego Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda.[21] 

 
Xbox 360 EliteThe Xbox 360 Elite is the fourth and most expensive variation of the console. It includes a 120 GB hard drive and a matte black finish. The Elite retail package also includes an HDMI 1.2 cable and a controller and headset that match the system's black finish.[25] The initial release price was USDollar479.99,[26] CDollar549.99,[26] Pound 299.99, and AUDollar729.95. The Elite was released in Europe on August 24, 2007, and Australia on August 30, 2007. Early Elite models shipped using the Zephyr motherboard, though newer models now use the Falcon 65nm chipset instead. These Elites (and other Xbox 360 models using the Falcon) can be identified from earlier versions by a re-designed power connector and a power supply that runs at 175w. The motherboard layout is also different. Holiday 2008 consoles are bundled with Lego Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda.[21]

Special editions
 
Halo 3 Special Edition Xbox 360 
The Simpsons Special Edition Xbox 360On a few occasions, Microsoft has produced special editions of the console, usually to coincide with the release of a major product. These special editions are typically custom-colored Xbox 360 models, and are produced in limited numbers.

At the E3 2007 press conference, Microsoft announced the Halo 3 Special Edition console, released September 16, 2007. It sports a Halo 3 theme on the console, wired headset, wireless controller, and play and charge kit. Other than the unique 'Spartan green and gold' color scheme, exclusive dashboard theme and downloads, and a HDMI port,[30] its features were identical to those of the Premium system at that time.[31] It is priced at USDollar399.99 and Pound 279.99 (the original price of the Xbox 360 Premium).[32] 
To promote The Simpsons Movie, Microsoft created a specially designed, yellow Xbox 360 console.[33] The configuration was based on the Xbox 360 Premium package of the time, the only difference being the color scheme of the Xbox 360 console and wireless controller. The consoles were to be given out to winners of drawings taking place between July 18, 2007 and July 27, 2007, in which a name was randomly drawn each day in the '10 Days and 10 Chances to Win' sweepstakes.[34] Ten consoles were produced in total.[34] 

Holiday Bundles
As with the original Xbox, Microsoft has continued bundling two video game titles in console retail packaging during the Holiday season. In Holiday 2007, Pro and Elite packages were bundled with Forza 2 and Marvel: Ultimate Alliance[35]. Holiday 2008 Pro and Elite packages are bundled with Lego Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda, while Arcade consoles are bundled with Sega Superstars Tennis.[21]


Compatibility
The Xbox 360 is also compatible with the Zune, which was posted on the Xbox Official Website. The Xbox 360 can play media files from the Zune only from an Xbox 360 update available on Xbox Live or from the Xbox 360 Official Website.[36] It is also compatible with Apple's iPod, excluding the iPod Touch and iPhone, by being able to play MP3 files natively and unprotected AAC files through the installation of the Optional Media Update available for free on Xbox Live.[37] Protected AAC files are not supported. The Xbox 360 will use the iPod's database for media information and works with both Windows (FAT32) and Mac (HFS+) formatted iPods. Pictures stored on the iPod can also be viewed but videos (protected or unprotected) and podcasts are not supported.


Hardware and accessories

Hardware
Main article: Xbox 360 hardware
The main unit of the Xbox 360 itself has slight double concavity in matte white or black. It features a port on the top (when vertical, left side when horizontal) to which a custom-housed hard drive unit can be attached in sizes of either 20, 60 (August 2008 onward) or 120 GB. Inside, the Xbox 360 uses the triple-core IBM designed Xenon as its CPU. Graphics processing is handled by the ATI Xenos which has 10 MB of eDRAM. Its main memory pool is 512 MB in size.


Accessories
Main article: Xbox 360 accessories
 
The Xbox 360 Wireless headsetMany accessories are available for the console, including both wired and wireless controllers, faceplates for customization, headsets for chatting, a webcam for video chatting, dance mats and Gamercize for exercise, three sizes of memory cards, and three sizes of hard drives (120GB, 60GB, and 20GB), among other items, all of which are styled to match the console.


Software

Dashboard
See also: Xbox 360 System Software 
The Xbox 360's original graphical user interface is the Xbox 360 Dashboard; a tabbed interface that features five 'Blades' (formerly four blades), and was designed by AKQA. It can be launched automatically when the console boots up without a disc, or when the disc tray is ejected. However, the user may choose to launch a game automatically if a disc is inserted. A simplified version of it can also be accessed at any time via the Xbox Guide button on the gamepad. This simplified version shows the user's gamercard, Xbox Live messages and friends list. It also allows for personal and music settings, in addition to voice or video chats, or returning to the primary Dashboard from the game.

As of November 19, 2008, the Xbox 360's dashboard has changed from the 'Blade' interface, to a dashboard reminiscent of that present on the Zune and Windows Media Center.

Since the console's release, Microsoft has released several updates for the Dashboard software. These updates have included adding new features to the console, enhancing Xbox Live functionality and multimedia playback cabilities, adding compatibility for new accessories, and fixing bugs in the software. The latest Dashboard update, revision 2.0.7357.0, was made available on November 19, 2008.


New Xbox Experience
Further information: Xbox Live#New Xbox Experience 
 
New Xbox 360 DashboardAt E3 2008, at Microsoft's Show, Microsoft's Aaron Greenberg and Marc Whitten announced the new look Xbox 360 called 'The New Xbox Experience'. The idea of the update is to allow people who cannot navigate the current Blade GUI, to navigate throughout the console easily. The GUI uses the Twist UI (used in Windows Media Center, Zune). The Blade interface is still used in the new Xbox Guide. The new guide allows you to do everything you could do from the Dashboard itself, whether it's ejecting a disk or browsing the Marketplace, thus making it easier to navigate throughout the system.

As well as a GUI update, many new features have been put into the system's software. Firstly, the update offers the ability to install games from the disk to the hard drive, reducing load times and disk drive noise. However, the game's disk must remain in the system to run its installed version. A new Community system is also built in, allowing the creation of digitalised Avatars. These Avatars can then be used for multiple activities such as sharing photos or playing Arcade games like 1 vs. 100. The update was released on November 19, 2008.[38]

While previous system updates have been stored on internal memory, this will be the first update to require a storage device. The update requires at least 128MB free space on either a memory card or a hard drive.[39] Microsoft has stated that many Core or Arcade users will not have sufficient space on their limited memory cards for the new update thus providing them with a free 512MB memory card or a discounted 20GB hard drive.[40][41]

There are reports not yet confirmed by Microsoft, but evident from screenshots of newer revision Arcade consoles with the chipset revision codenamed 'Jasper', that 256MB of internal memory has been added to the latest retail units. The 256MB memory card is rumored to be no longer included. This is likely for the purpose of storing the NXE update in addition to game data. [42]


Multimedia
 
Xbox 360 Wireless ControllerThe Xbox 360 supports videos in .wmv-format, as well as high-definition .wmv-videos, H.264, MPEG-4, and PlaysForSure WMV videos. The December 2007 dashboard update added support for the playback of MPEG-4 ASP format videos.[43] The console can also display pictures and perform slideshows of photo collections with various transition effects, and supports audio playback, with music player controls accessible through the Xbox 360 Guide button. Users may play back their own music while playing games or using the dashboard, and can play music with an interactive visual synthesizer.

Music, photos and videos can be played from standard USB mass storage devices, Xbox 360 proprietary storage devices (such as memory cards or Xbox 360 hard drives), and servers or computers with Windows Media Center or Windows XP with Service Pack 2 or higher within the local-area network in streaming mode.[44][45] As the Xbox 360 uses a modified version of the UPnP AV protocol,[46] some alternative UPnP servers such as uShare (part of the GeeXboX project) and MythTV can also stream media to the Xbox 360, allowing for similar functionality from non-Windows servers. This is possible with video files up to HD-resolution and with several codecs (MPEG-2, MPEG-4, WMV) and container formats (WMV, MOV, TS).[47]

In the UK the Xbox 360 will be enabled to download and display BT Vision video content.[48]


XNA community
XNA Community is a future feature where Xbox 360 owners can receive community created XNA Creators Club developed games made with Microsoft XNA Game Studio. The games are written, published, and distributed through a community managed portal. XNA Community will be a channel for console videogame delivery over Xbox Live that can be free of royalties, paid-software development kits, publishers or licenses.[49][50]

Halo 3At the 2008 Game Developer Conference, Microsoft announced there would be over 1000 games available for Xbox 360 by the end of the year.[51] The 2007 Game Critics Awards honoured the Xbox 360 platform with 38 Nominations and 11 Wins - more than any other platform.[52] By March 2008, the Xbox 360 had reached a software attach rate of 7.5 games per console -- a record for any console in history, in EU the rate was 7.0 while its competitors were 3.8 (PS3) and 3.5 (Wii).[53]

The Xbox 360 launched with 14 games in North America and 13 in Europe. The console's best-selling game for 2005, Call of Duty 2, sold over a million copies.[54] Five other games sold as well in the console's first year in the market: Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,[55] The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,[56] Dead or Alive 4,[57] Saints Row[58] and Gears of War.[59] Gears of War would become the best-selling game of the console with 3 million units,[60] before being surpassed in 2007 by Halo 3, with 8.1 million units.[2]

Six games were initially offered in Japan, and eagerly anticipated titles such as Dead or Alive 4 and Enchanted Arms were released only a few weeks later.[61] Games more suitable to the region were planned or have since been released, such as Chromehounds, Ninety-Nine Nights, and Phantasy Star Universe.[62] Microsoft also had the support of RPG developer Mistwalker, founded by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. Mistwalker's first game, Blue Dragon, was released in 2006 and had a limited-edition bundle which sold out quickly with over 10,000 pre-orders.[63] Blue Dragon became the best-selling Xbox 360 game in the region, with over 200,000 units. Mistwalker's second game, Lost Odyssey also sold over 100,000 copies.[64]

The Xbox 360 has managed to gain a simultaneous release of titles which were initially planned to be PS3 exclusive, including Devil May Cry,[65] Ace Combat,[66] Virtua Fighter,[67] and Final Fantasy XIII.[68], or PS3 timed exclusives, such as Grand Theft Auto 4.[69]

At E3 2007, Microsoft announced that Disney movies would be coming to Xbox 360 Live Marketplace. Gears of War was announced to be coming to the PC. New trailers were shown for Halo 3 and Halo Wars. A Halo-themed Xbox 360 was also announced. Details on Civilization Revolution and Fallout 3 were given. BioShock, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and Assassin's Creed for Xbox 360, as well as Crysis for the PC were demoed. At E3 2008, Microsoft announced a number of titles for their 2009 line-up, including Fallout 3, Gears of War 2, Fable II, and Resident Evil 5, among other games. A television-style gaming feature known as Primetime was shown with a game based on the game show 1 vs. 100 shown as an example, there were also hints at a Big Brother type game and also a Deal or no Deal one. Final Fantasy XIII was also announced to be released for Xbox 360 in Europe and North America.


Xbox Live
Main article: Xbox Live
 
Official logo of Xbox Live 
The Original Xbox Live DashboardOn the day of the Xbox 360's release, Microsoft's online gaming service Xbox Live was shut down for 24 hours and went through a major upgrade, adding a basic non-subscription service, Silver, to its already established premium subscription-based service (which was renamed Gold). Xbox Live Silver is free of charge and is included with all SKUs of the console. It allows users to create a user profile, join on message boards, and access Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade and Marketplace and talk to other members.[70] A Live Silver account does not generally support multiplayer gaming; however, some games that have rather limited online functions already, (such as Viva Pinata) or games that feature their own subscription service (eg. EA Sports games) can be played with a Silver account. Xbox Live also supports voice and video communication, the latter a feature possible with the Xbox Live Vision; an add-on USB web camera designed specifically for the Xbox 360.[71] The Gamercard of a player with a Silver account has a silver trim, rather than gold.

Xbox Live Gold has the same features as Silver and includes integrated online game playing capabilities outside of third-party subscriptions. Microsoft has allowed previous Xbox Live subscribers to maintain their profile information, friends list, and games history when they make the transition to Xbox Live Gold. To transfer an Xbox Live account to the new system, users need to link a Windows Live ID to their gamertag on Xbox.com.[72] When users add an Xbox Live enabled profile to their console, they are required to provide the console with their passport account information and the last four digits of their credit card number, which is used for verification purposes and billing. An Xbox Live Gold account has an annual cost of USDollar49.99, CDollar59.99, NZD 90.00, GBPound 39.99, or €59.99. As of May 14, 2008, Xbox Live has over 12 million subscribers.[73]


Xbox Live Marketplace
Main article: Xbox Live Marketplace
 
Original Xbox Live MarketplaceThe Xbox Live Marketplace is a virtual market designed for the console that allows Xbox Live users to download purchased or promotional content. The service offers movie and game trailers, game demos, Xbox Live Arcade games, gamertag images, and Xbox 360 Dashboard themes as well as add-on game content (items, costumes, levels etc). These features are available to both silver and gold members on Xbox Live. A hard drive or memory unit is required to store products purchased from Xbox Live Marketplace.[74] In order to download priced content, users are required to purchase Microsoft Points for use as scrip;[75] though some products (such as trailers) are free to download. Users are able to view items available to download on the service through a PC via the Xbox Live Pipeline website.[76] An estimated seventy percent of Xbox Live users have downloaded items from the Marketplace.[77]


Video Store
 
Original Xbox Video MarketplaceOn November 6, 2006, Microsoft announced the Xbox Video Marketplace, an exclusive video store accessible through the console. Launched in the United States on November 22, 2006, the first anniversary of the Xbox 360's launch, the service allows users in the United States to download high-definition and standard-definition television shows and movies onto an Xbox 360 console for viewing. With the exception of short clips, content is not currently available for streaming, and must be downloaded. Microsoft has also announced that its Microsoft TV service will add IPTV functionality to the console, giving users the ability to stream 2 simultaneous HD and 2 simultaneous SD channels.[78] Movies are also available for rental. They expire in 14 days after download or at the end of the first 24 hours after the movie has begun playing, whichever comes first. Television episodes can be purchased to own, and are transferable to an unlimited number of consoles. Downloaded files use 5.1 surround audio and are encoded using VC-1 for video at 720p, with a bitrate of 6.8 Mbit/s.[79] Television content is offered from MTV, VH1, Comedy Central, Turner Broadcasting, and CBS; and movie content is Warner Bros., Paramount, and Disney, along with other publishers.[80]

After the Spring 2007 update, the following video codecs are supported:

H.264 video support: Up to 15 Mbit/s, Baseline, Main, and High (up to level 4.1) Profiles with 2 channel AAC LC and Main Profiles. 
MPEG-4 Part 2 video support: Up to 8 Mbit/s, Simple Profile with 2 channel AAC LC and Main Profiles. 
As a late addition to the December Xbox 360 update, 25 movies were added to the European Xbox 360 video market place on the December 11, 2007 and cost 250 Microsoft points for the SD version on the movie and 380 Microsoft points for the HD version of the movie.[81] Xbox Live members in Canada featured the ability to go on the Xbox Live Marketplace as of December 10, 2007 with around 30 movies to be downloaded for the same amount of Microsoft Points.


Xbox Live Arcade
Main article: Xbox Live Arcade
 
Original Xbox Live ArcadeXbox Live Arcade is an online service operated by Microsoft that is used to distribute downloadable video games to Xbox and Xbox 360 owners. In addition to classic arcade games such as Ms. Pac-Man, the service offers some new original games like Assault Heroes. The Xbox Live Arcade also features games from other consoles, such as the PlayStation game Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and PC games such as Zuma. The service was first launched on November 3, 2004,[82] using a DVD to load, and offered games for about USDollar5 to Dollar15. Items are purchased using Microsoft Points, a proprietary currency used to reduce credit card transaction charges. On November 22, 2005, Xbox Live Arcade was re-launched with the release of the Xbox 360, in which it was now integrated with the Xbox 360's dashboard. The games are generally aimed toward more casual gamers; examples of the more popular titles are Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved, Street Fighter II' Hyper Fighting, and UNO.[83]



Sales
Region Units sold First available 
Canada 870,000 as of August 1, 2008[84] November 22, 2005 
United States 11.6 million as of November 1, 2008[85] November 22, 2005

Worldwide 22 million as of September 30, 2008[1] (more...) 
The Xbox 360 began production only 69 days before launch.[89][90] As a result, Microsoft was not able to supply enough systems to meet initial consumer demand in Europe or North America.[91] Many potential customers were not able to purchase a console at launch. Forty thousand units appeared on eBay during the initial week of release; this was 10 percent of the total supply.[92] By year's end, Microsoft had shipped 1.5 million units, including 900,000 in North America, 500,000 in Europe, and 100,000 in Japan.[93]

At E3 in May 2006, Bill Gates announced that Microsoft would have a head start of 10 million units by the time Sony and Nintendo entered the market.[94] Microsoft later specified that goal and estimated shipments of 10 million units by the end of 2006.[95]

Cumulative sales from the system's launch until June 30, 2007 were predicted to reach 12 million units, down from 13 to 15 million units estimated earlier. Being released one year ahead of its competitors, the Xbox 360 was the market leader throughout the first half of 2007; however, on September 12, 2007, it was reported by the Financial Times that the Xbox 360 had been surpassed by the Wii in terms of worldwide home console sales.[96]

On October 4, 2007, after the launch of Halo 3, Microsoft stated that Xbox 360 sales had more than doubled compared to the previous average.[97] According to the NPD Group, the Xbox 360 outsold the Wii for the month of September in the United States, helped in part by the spike in sales seen after the launch of Halo 3, which sold 3.3 million copies in the US in a 12-day period.[98] The Xbox had sales of 528,000 units for September, while the Wii had sales of 501,000 units.[99]

However, despite these sales figures, Microsoft's gaming division is losing money. Through 2005, the Xbox gaming division had lost over Dollar4 billion.[100] However, Microsoft expects the console will start making money in 2008.[101] The losses are due to the market strategy of selling consoles below cost in order to obtain market saturation and gain profits on software and peripherals that have a much higher profit margin.[102][103] Also notable is that Microsoft has taken a charge of Dollar1 billion dollars on its June 2007 Income Statement to account for the cost of replacing bricked Xbox 360s.[104]

In Europe, the Xbox 360 sold 2 million units in 2006 and 1.9 million in 2007 according to estimates by Electronic Arts.[105][106] In 2007, the Xbox 360 had sold 4.62 million units in the US according to the NPD Group,[107][108][109] and 257,841 in Japan, according to Enterbrain.[110][111]

On February 13, 2008, Microsoft announced that the Xbox 360 suffered shortages in the US in January 2008, possibly continued into February.[112][113][114] Prior to the release of the NPD Group's video game statistics for January 2008, the Xbox 360 has been in second place behind the Wii in US sales in most months since the Wii and PS3 were released, according to data by the NPD Group.[113] On May 14, 2008, Microsoft announced that 10 million Xbox 360s had been sold and that it was the 'first current generation gaming console' to surpass the 10 million figure in the US.[115] In the US, the Xbox 360 was the leader in current-generation home console sales until June 2008, when it was surpassed by the Wii which was released a year later than the Xbox 360;[116][117][118] the Xbox 360 has sold 11.6 million units as of November 1, 2008, according to the NPD Group.[85]

In the first seven months of 2008, the Xbox 360 has sold 154,000 units in Canada, being outsold by the PlayStation 3 and Wii;[84] the Xbox 360 has sold a total of 870,000 units in Canada as of August 1, 2008.[84] In the United Kingdom, the Xbox 360 has sold 2.3 million units as of September 2008, according to GfK Chart-Track.[87] In Japan, the Xbox 360 has sold 748,992 units as of October 1, 2008, according to Famitsu.[88] In Europe, the Xbox 360 has sold seven million units as of November 20, 2008, according to Microsoft.[86]

Technical problems

The Xbox 360 can be subject to a number of technical problems. Since the console's release in 2005, the product earned note in the press questioning its reliability and failure rate of the consoles.[122][123][124]

To aid customers with defective consoles, Microsoft has extended the Xbox 360's manufacturer's warranty to three years for hardware failure problems that generate a 'General Hardware Failure' error report. A 'General Hardware Failure' is recognized by three quadrants of the ring around the power button flashing red. This error is often known as the 'Red Ring of Death'.[125] The warranty extension is not granted for any other types of failures that do not generate this specific error code.

Since these problems surfaced, Microsoft has attempted to modify the console to improve its reliability. Modifications include a reduction in the number, size, and placement of components, the addition of dabs of epoxy on the corners and edges of the CPU and GPU as glue to prevent movement relative to the board during heat expansion,[126] and a second GPU heatsink to dissipate more heat.[127] It is unclear whether these modifications have only been added to new consoles or if they have also been added to consoles repaired by Microsoft and authorized repair centers
