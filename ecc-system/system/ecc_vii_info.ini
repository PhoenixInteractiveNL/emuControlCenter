description = "Jungle Soft's Sport Vii is a video game console similar in aspect to the Nintendo's Wii.[1] Originally released in China in 2007, according to Engadget China the console used to sell for 1,280 Yuan; now in 2009 the Vii sells for 443 Yuan a substantially lower price. The Vii is not a competitive console in the current generation; instead, it competes in the 'plug-in TV game' genre of inexpensive consoles with built-in games. It is based on the 16-bit SunPlus SPG CPU.

The Vii's Handybar controller is similar in design to the Wii Remote but is smaller in size. It features motion detection but not the pointing capability of the Wii Remote.

The Vii remotes also come in different colors.

Available Colors:

    * Arctic White
    * Hot Pink
    * Mint Blue.

A redesign of the console, colloquially called the Vii 2 by bloggers, features remodeled controllers and a console design reminiscent of the Nintendo Entertainment System and the PlayStation 3,[3] as well as support for both NTSC and PAL televisions.[4]

In 2008, the Vii was released in Japan under the name V-Sports (Sport Vii)
(Info: Wikipedia)

The vii interactive game is to achieve the purpose of entertainment and body-training through the body movement and operation of the player.

Vii means a Very Interesting Interactive game console for those who can not afford wii, as vii is only 50% lesser and has the following:

- A legitimate interactive video game in China and wii is not
- Combining entertainment, sports, and family fun
- Wireless motion sensitive control
