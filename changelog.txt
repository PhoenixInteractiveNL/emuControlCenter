Update 00620 2016-09-02
- CORE
  - Reworked configuration GUI, placed options together where needed, deleted old options and TABS.
  - Selectable ECC DATABASE path!, put your database on a central location so every computer
    in a network can run the same data!
    - Some notes setting and using the ECC DATABASE path:
      - With manual input always use a ending slash \.
      - Network paths are not listed, but you can type them manually like: \\COMPUTER\PATH\.
      - Wrong pathnames or no rights to write will reset the DB tot he default "ecc-system\database" location.
      - When configuring a location of a existing ECC configuration/database, you have to copy the database
        manually to the new location.
      - You may experience slow response form ECC when you store the datbaase on a network path.
      - ECC is not tested to run from multiple computers with the same database,
        the database could be "in use by another application" let me know if it works!
  - Added a new PHP class "ecc-system\manager\cIniFileRegular.php" to read and write INI files easily.
  - Database "empty" is now the updated version (save some scripts to be executed everytime)
  - Added some more translations to be made in the GUI.
