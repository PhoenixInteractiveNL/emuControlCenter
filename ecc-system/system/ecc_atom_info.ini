description = "The Atom was {Acorn's} first computer to be aimed squarely at the home market.

The Acorn Atom was a {home computer} made by {Acorn Computers Ltd} from 1980 to 1981 when it was replaced by the {BBC Micro} (originally Proton) and later the {Acorn Electron}.

The Atom was a progression of the {MOS Technology} {6502} based machines that the company had been making from 1979. The Atom was a cut-down {Acorn System 3} without a disk drive but with an integral keyboard and cassette tape interface, sold in either kit or complete form. In 1980 it was priced between {£}120 in {kit} form, £170 ready assembled, to over £200 for the fully expanded version with 12 {KB} of {RAM} and the floating point extension {ROM}.

The minimum Atom had 2 KB of {RAM} and 8 KB of {ROM}, with a fully loaded machine having 12 KB of each. An additional {floating point} {ROM} was also available. The 12 KB of {RAM} was divided between 5 KB available for programs, 1 KB for the page zero and 6 KB for the high resolution graphics. The page zero memory (a.k.a. zero page memory) was used by the CPU for stack storage, by the OS, and by the Atom BASIC for variable storage of the 27 variables. If high resolution graphics were not required then 5 1/2 KB of the upper memory could be used for program storage.

It had a {MC6847} VDG {video chip} (Video Display Generator), allowing for text or two-colour graphics modes. It could be connected to a TV or modified to output to a video monitor. Basic video memory was 1 KB but could be expanded to 6 KB. A {PAL} colour card was also available. Six video modes were available, with resolutions from 64×64 in 4 colours, up to 256×192 in monochrome. At the time 256×192 was considered to be high resolution.

It had built-in {BASIC} ({Atom BASIC}), a fast but idiosyncratic version, which included indirection operators (similar to {PEEK and POKE}) for bytes and words (4 bytes). {Assembly code} could be included within a BASIC program, because the BASIC interpreter also contained an {Assembler} for the 6502 assembly language which assembled the inline code during program execution and then executed it. This was a very unusual, but also very useful, function.

In late 1982, Acorn released an upgrade ROM chip for the Atom which allowed users to switch between Atom BASIC and the more advanced BASIC used by the BBC Micro. The upgrade was purely to the programming language; the Atom's graphics and sound capabilities remained unchanged, and hence, contrary to some pre-release beliefs, the BBC BASIC ROM did not allow Atom users to run commercial BBC Micro software, since nearly all of it took advantage of the BBC machine's advanced graphics and sound hardware.

The manual for the Atom was called {Atomic theory and practice}

The Acorn {LAN}, {Econet}, was first configured on the Atom.

The case was designed by industrial designer {Allen Boothroyd} of Cambridge Product Design Ltd.
