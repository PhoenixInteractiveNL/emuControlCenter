ST-V (Sega Titan Video game system) was an arcade system board released by Sega in 1995. Unlike existing arcade hardware at the time, the ST-V's hardware was essentially identical to their home console system, the Sega Saturn, with the only difference being that the Saturn used CDs to store games, while the ST-V used cartridges. This allowed for very 'pure' ports from arcade to the console. The majority of ST-V titles were released in Japan only. Being derived from the Saturn hardware, the system was presumably named for the moon Titan, a satellite of Saturn. Games released for the ST-V includes the arcade version of Virtua Fighter Remix, Golden Axe: The Duel and Final Fight Revenge.
