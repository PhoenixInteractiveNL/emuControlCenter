Cybiko was a hand held computer designed for teenagers featuring its own two-way radio text messaging system. It had over 430 'official' freeware games and applications. Because of the text messaging system, it features a QWERTY Keyboard that was used with a stylus. An MP3 player add-on was made for the unit as well as a SmartMedia card reader. The company stopped manufacturing the units after two product versions and only a few years on the market, but because of the unique radio messaging hardware there is still a hobbyist community using Cybiko.

Cybikos can communicate with each other up to a maximum range of 300 metres (0.19 miles) (which can be boosted to 450 metres (0.26 miles) using a freeware program called UI Power). Several Cybikos can chat with each other in a wireless chatroom.


Cybiko Classic
Cybiko Xtreme with antenna folded down.There are two models of the Classic Cybiko. The obvious difference is that version 1 has a switch on the side; version two uses the 'ESC' key for power management. The not-so-obvious differences between the two are the internal memory changes and the location of the firmware.

The CPU is an Hitachi H8S/2241 at 11.0592 MHz and it also has an Atmel AT90S2313 co-processor at 4 MHz to provide some support for RF communications. It came with 512 KB ROM flash memory and 256 KB RAM. It came with an add-on slot in the back.

The add-on slot has the same physical appearance (pin-count, spacing) as PC card, but it is not compatible.


Cybiko Xtreme
The Cybiko Xtreme (commonly misspelt 'Extreme') is the 2nd-generation Cybiko handheld. It boasts many improvements over the "classic" Cybiko, such as a faster processor, more RAM, more ROM, a new OS, a new keyboard layout and case design, greater wireless range, a microphone, improved audio output, and smaller size.

The CPU is an Hitachi H8S/2323 at 18 MHz and it also has an Atmel AT90S2313 co-processor at 4 MHz to provide some support for RF communications. It came with 512 KB ROM flash memory and 1.5 MB RAM. It came with an add-on slot in the back, but the only hardware released was an MP3 player.
