<h1>AutoIt Window Information Tool </h1>
<p>AutoIt v3 comes with a standalone tool called the <strong>AutoIt Window Info Tool </strong> 
  (<font size="-2">Program Files\AutoIt3\AU3Info.exe</font>).&nbsp;AU3Info allows you to get information from a specified window that 
  can be used to effectively automate it.&nbsp; Information that can be obtained 
  includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;<a href="windowsbasic.html">Window titles</a></li>
  <li>&nbsp;Text on the window (visible and hidden)</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Window size and position</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Contents of the status bar</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Position of the mouse pointer</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Colour of the pixels underneath the mouse pointer</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Details of the <em><a href="controls.html">Control</a></em> underneath the mouse pointer</li>
</ul>
<p>To use AU3Info just run it (from the command line or Start menu).&nbsp; AU3Info 
  will remain the top most window at all times so that you can read it.&nbsp; 
  Once active move to the window you are interested in and activate it - the contents 
  of AU3Info will change to show the information that is available.&nbsp; With 
  the help of AU3Info you should be automating in no time!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When AU3Info is running you may want to copy text directly from it using <strong>CTRL-C</strong> 
  and then paste it into your script to avoid spelling/case errors. For the tabs that have information in a list view (like the control information shown below) just <strong>double-click</strong> on an entry to copy it to the clipboard.&nbsp; This 
  can be difficult when you want to capture pixel/mouse information as it keeps 
  changing!&nbsp; To help with this you can &quot;freeze&quot; the output of AU3Info 
  by pressing <strong>CTRL-ALT-F</strong>.&nbsp; Press the keys again to &quot;unfreeze&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an example of AU3Info in use with the Windows &quot;WordPad&quot; editor:</p>
