description = "The EXL100 was introduced in France in 1984.

It came with an optional color ( 8 colors ) Peritel monitor, a standard cartridge loader and an optional tape drive. The two joysticks and the keyboard had an Infra Red connection. It also had a pretty good integrated speech synthethesizer. The lack of available software came from the rare Texas Intruments CPU used in the EXL100.

The EXL 100 was done by people who worked at Texas Instruments. It uses a lot of technologies of the TI CC40 (like the basic and the CPU for exemple). All the hardware is based on Texas Instruments chips. The TMS 7020 is the CPU, the TMS 7041 manages all I/O, the speech synthesizer (TMS 5220) and the infrared receiver. The keyboard and the joysticks are linked by infrared to the CPU. 

Several peripherals were developped for this computer : a dot matrix printer (EXL 80) and a modem (ExelModem). This computer didn't have a great market success. It was above all used in schools.
