description = "
The Lynx was the world's first hand-held color video game system.  Sold by Atari (developed by Epyx a few years earlier), the Lynx offered true multi-player competition, built-in 3D and distortion graphic effects, reversible controls, and fast arcade action.
The system featured some accurate arcade translations such as Joust, Rampart, and Klax.

The Lynx II is a lightweight redesign and features stereo sound and shorter power down timer.

Around 1993 Atari ceased marketing the Lynx and focused on their new console, the Jaguar. (Notes taken from FAQ and Atari Age)
