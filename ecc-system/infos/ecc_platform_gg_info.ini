The Game Gear is the portable version of the Sega Master System, with slightly enhanced graphics and stereo sound. The Game Gear would compete in a tough market with the Atari Lynx, the NEC Turbo Express and the industry leader Nintendo Gameboy. With an adaptor you could play SMS games on the Game Gear. A TV tuner also turned the system into a portable television set. Game gear featured many of the Sega Standard games, like Sonic the Hedgehog, Shinobi, Super Monaco GP and Ecco the Dolphin.
