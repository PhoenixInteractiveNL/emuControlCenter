MSX was the name of a standardized home computer architecture in the 1980s. It was a Microsoft-led attempt to create unified standards among hardware makers, conceived by one-time Microsoft Japan executive Kazuhiko Nishi. Despite Microsoft's involvement, MSX-based machines were seldom seen in the United States but were hugely popular in other markets. Eventually 5 million MSX-based units were sold world-wide.

Nishi proposed MSX as an attempt to create a single industry standard for home computers. Inspired by the success of VHS as a standard for video cassette recorders, many Japanese electronic manufacturers along with Goldstar, Philips and Spectravideo built and promoted MSX computers. Any piece of hardware or software with the MSX logo on it was compatible with MSX products of other manufacturers. In particular, the expansion cartridge form and function were part of the standard; any MSX expansion or game cartridge would work in any MSX computer.

Nishi's standard consisted primarily of several off-the-shelf parts; the main CPU was a 3.58 MHz Zilog Z80, the graphics chip a Texas Instruments TMS9918 with 16 KB of dedicated VRAM, and the sound was provided by the AY-3-8910 chip manufactured by General Instrument (GI). These components alongside Microsoft's MSX BASIC made the MSX a competitive, though somewhat more expensive home computer package. This design closely resembled the Spectravideo SV-328 home computer, but was not completely compatible with it. Spectravideo later launched a system, the SV-728 which did adhere to the MSX standard.

Before the appearance and great success of the Nintendo Famicom, MSX was the platform for which major Japanese game studios, such as Konami and Hudson Soft, produced their titles. The Metal Gear series was originally written for MSX hardware.

 
History

In the 1980s Japan was in the midst of an economic awakening. Large Japanese electronics firms may have been successful in the early computer market had they made a concerted effort in the late 1970s. Their combined design and manufacturing power could have allowed them to produce competitive machines, but they initially ignored the home computer market and appear to have been hesitant to do business in a market where no industry standard existed.

When MSX was announced and a slew of big Japanese firms announced their plans to introduce machines, it set off a wave of panic in the U.S. industry. However, the Japanese companies avoided the intensely competitive U.S. home computer market, which was in the throes of a Commodore-led price war. Only Spectravideo and Yamaha briefly marketed MSX machines in the U.S. Spectravideo's MSX enjoyed very little success, and Yamaha's CX5M model, built to interface with various types of MIDI equipment, was billed more as a digital music tool than a standard personal computer.

During the 1980s Europe became the largest computer games (as opposed to console games) market in the world, and the extremely popular Commodore 64 and Sinclair ZX Spectrum computers dominated. By the time the MSX launched in Europe several more popular 8-bit home computers had also arrived, and it was far too late to capture the extremely crowded European 8-bit computer market.

Consequently, MSX never became the worldwide standard that its makers had envisioned, mainly because it never took off in the United States or most of Europe. In Japan and South Korea, MSX was the paramount home computer system in the 1980s. It was also popular in The Netherlands, Spain, Brazil, some Arab countries and the Soviet Union.

The exact meaning of the 'MSX' abbreviation remains a matter of debate. At the time, most people seemed to agree it meant 'MicroSoft eXtended', referring to the built-in MSX-BASIC programming language, specifically adapted by Microsoft for the MSX system. However, according to Kazuhiko Nishi during a recent visit to Tilburg in the Netherlands, MSX stands for 'Machines with Software eXchangeability'. The MSX-DOS disk operating system had file system compatibility with CP/M and was similar to MS-DOS. In this way, Microsoft could promote MSX for home use while promoting MS-DOS based personal computers in office environments.

MSX spawned four generations: MSX 1 (1983), MSX 2 (1986), MSX 2+ (1988) and MSX turbo R (1990). The first three were 8-bit computers based on the Z80 microprocessor, while the MSX turbo R was based on an enhanced Zilog Z800 known as the R800. The Turbo R was introduced in 1990 but was unsuccessful due to a lack of support and the rise in popularity of the by then well-established IBM PC Compatible market. Production of the Turbo R ended in 1995.
In total, 5 million MSX computers were sold, which made it relatively popular but not the global standard it was intended to be. For a comparison with rival 8-bit computers, the Commodore 64 sold 17 million units worldwide in its lifetime, the Amstrad CPC sold 3 million units, the Apple II sold 2 million units, and the Tandy TRS-80 sold 250,000 units.


MSX Revival

*	In 2001, Kazuhiko Nishi initiated an 'MSX Revival' around an official MSX emulator called MSXPLAYer. This is the only official MSX emulator. All MSX copyrights are maintained by the MSX Association. 
*	In 2004 Dutch company Bazix announced they had become the representatives of MSX Association in Europe, being the English contact for any questions regarding the MSX trademarks and copyrights (licensing). 
*	On October 17, 2006, Bazix launched WOOMB.Net, a website selling MSX games (translated to English if necessary), with a selection of 14 games. In Japan, game sales began earlier, through Project EGG. WOOMB.Net is the English counterpart of this (and other) Japanese services offered by D4 Enterprise. 
*	D4 Enterprise also announced (in August 2006) the launch of a new MSX2 compatible system called the 'one chip-MSX', a system based on an Altera Cyclone EP1C12Q240C8 FPGA. The 'one chip-MSX' is similar in concept to the C-One, a Commodore 64 clone also build on the basis of a single FPGA chip. The new MSX system is housed in a box made out of transparent blue plastic, and can be used with a standard monitor (or TV) and a PC keyboard. It has two MSX cartridge slots and supports the audio extensions MSX-MUSIC and SCC+. A SD/MMC-flashcard can be used as an external storage medium, emulating a disk drive and can be used to boot MSX-DOS. Due to its VHDL programmable hardware it is possible to give the device new hardware extensions simply by running a reconfiguration program under MSX-DOS. The 'one chip-MSX' also has two USB connectors that can be used after adding some supporting VHDL code. 
*	In 2006 Nintendo of Japan posted on its Virtual Console webpage that MSX games will be available for Wii's Virtual Console emulator. In February 2007, it was confirmed again and announced that the games would cost 800 Wii Points and will become available in Spring 2007 (for Japan only, at least initially). 


MSX trivia

*	The birthday of the MSX Home Computer Standard is June 27, 1983, the day it was formally announced during a press-conference. 
*	MSX 1 computers were very similar to the Colecovision and Sega SG-1000 video game systems. They shared the same CPU and video processors. Their sound processors were also very similar. A Colecovision emulator for the MSX exists. 
*	By far, the most popular and famous MSX games were written by Japanese software-house Konami. 
*	As the MSX's processor, the Zilog Z80A, could only address up to 64 kB of memory, the default allocation (used in most, if not all models) was with the lower 32 kB for ROM BASIC and the upper 32 kB for RAM. Machines intended to run MSX-DOS (a CP/M-like system) had 64 kB RAM, but the lower 32 kB were disabled in order for the ROM BASIC to function. When the computer booted MSX-DOS, the ROM BASIC was disabled and all of the 64 kB address space was mapped to RAM. 
*	Among MSX-DOS compatible software (directly ported from CP/M) were dBase II, Turbo Pascal version 3 and Wordstar. Therefore, in the late 1980s, several Brazilian companies used an MSX system as their 'corporate' computer. As an MSX 1 could display only 40x25 text, expansion kits were introduced that upgraded the display to 80x25, giving MSX a more professional appeal. MSX 2 and up were never manufactured by the main companies in Brazil (Gradiente and Sharp). Much of the market was created alone by Ademir Carchano (MSX Projetos et al) who created most of the aftermarket hardware for MSX, including the MegaRAM cartridge (a way to copy and play MegaROM games), the MSX 2.0 and 2+ conversion kits and IDE interfaces. Although cheaper IBM-PC clones eventually dominated the market, the MSX remained somewhat popular, with hardware being created and sold for substantial prices for some time afterwards. 
*	MSX 1 games were published mainly on cartridge and cassette. Later in the 1980s the MSX 2 was released, which generally included a 3.5' disk drive, and consequently the popular media for games and other software shifted to floppy disks. 
*	The MSX 3.5' floppy disks, at least those formatted under MSX-DOS 2.0, were directly compatible with MS-DOS (although some details like file undeletion and boot sector code were different).
*	The introduction of MSX led to a new and short-lived kind of software cracking: converting. Since the MSX games were unplayable on the SV-328 computer, SV-328 crackers developed a method of modifying the (MSX 1) games to make them work on the SV-328. In most cases this included downloading the MSX BIOS to the SV-328 from tape or floppy disk. 
*	Due to the same processor (Z80), graphical resolution (256x192 pixels) and number of colors (16) of the MSX 1 systems and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, many videogames made for the latter could easily be ported to the MSX platform by the (European) authors themselves, making both versions nearly identical. The enhanced color display possibilities of the MSX were not exploited: they did not used any hardware sprites, and the color by character style of the ZX Spectrum graphics was directly used, instead of using the MSX's more advanced facility to have a different color pair for each line in the character.
