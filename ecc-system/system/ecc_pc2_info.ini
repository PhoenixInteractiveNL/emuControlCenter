Note: Its not really a gaming device. It is a mobile learning device. 
Why it is in the collection? It is some kind of a Video-Game-Curiosium:
Bandai licensed its WonderSwan Hardware to Benesse for the Pocket Challenge V2 so almost every Pocket Challenge Software is compatible to the WonderSwan. Because of the missing WonderSwan Rom in the Pocket Challenge V2, only some WonderSwan Games are compatible with the Pocket Challenge V2.
