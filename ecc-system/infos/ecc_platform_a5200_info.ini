description = "
The Atari 5200 was introduced in 1982, and was actually designed to be a competitor to the Intellivision, before ColecoVision entered the market. Developed under the name of Pam (Atari, at the time, typically named projects after well-endowed female employees), Atari considered releasing it with that moniker; PAM in this case an acronym for Personal Arcade Machine

The 5200 shared much of the architecture of the Atari 400/800 computers, but featured a different cartridge connector and completely different controllers. Non-centering analogue joysticks which offered a full 360 degrees of mobility, were both innovative and unreliable. Other controller features included a keypad, and a ahead-of-it's-time pause button.

The Atari 5200 suffered from it's initial incompatibility with the VCS/2600 (an adapter was later released) and fierce competition from Coleco. When Warner Communications sold Atari Corp. to the Tramiels in 1984, they quickly removed it from the market.
