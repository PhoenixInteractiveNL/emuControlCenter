<h1>Window Titles and Text (Basic)</h1>
<p>When automating, most windows can be uniquely identified by their <strong>title</strong> 
  or a combination of their <strong>title &amp; text</strong>.&nbsp; And by using 
  <a href="au3spy.html">AutoIt Window Info Tool </a> (or even by sight) this information 
  is easy to obtain.&nbsp; The titles of most windows are fairly obvious, for example 
  <strong>Untitled - Notepad</strong> is the title of the notepad.exe editor and 
  in many cases this is enough to automate.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000FF">Note: If a blank string &quot;&quot; is given 
  for both <em>title</em> and <em>text</em> then the currently <em>Active</em> 
  window will be used (this is not true in some of the more advanced <a href="../functions/AutoItSetOption.html#WinTitleMatchMode">WinTitleMatchModes</a>)!</font></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Window titles and text are <strong>case sensitive</strong>.&nbsp; You must 
  match the case and punctuation exactly.&nbsp; To avoid problems select the title/text 
  in the Window Info Tool and use <strong>ctrl-c</strong> to copy it and then paste 
  it directly into your script. <br>
You can force match in lower case using <b> <a href="windowsadvanced.html">advanced modes</a></b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of AutoIt's window functions have space for a title and text entry, here
  is the WinWaitActive function.&nbsp; This function pauses execution of the script
  <em><strong>until</strong></em> the specified window appears and is active.</p>
<p class="codebox">WinWaitActive ( &quot;<strong>title</strong>&quot;,
  [&quot;<strong>text</strong>&quot;], [timeout] )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>title</strong></em> is the only required parameter for this function, 
  both the <em><strong>text</strong></em> and <em><strong>timeout</strong></em> 
  are optional.&nbsp; In some functions the <em><strong>text</strong></em> parameter 
  is not optional, if you do not wish to specify any text then just use <strong>&quot;&quot;</strong> 
  (a blank string).&nbsp; A blank string, or nothing at all, in the <em><strong>text</strong></em> 
  tells AutoIt that any text is valid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use the above function with any notepad window both these methods will work:</p>
<p class="codebox"> WinWaitActive(&quot;Untitled - Notepad&quot;)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p class="codebox"> WinWaitActive(&quot;Untitled - Notepad&quot;, &quot;&quot;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the same notepad window had &quot;This is a line of text&quot; typed into
  the window, the <a href="au3spy.html">Window Info Tool </a> would show:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../images/au3spy_notepad.png" width="463" height="512"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that the Window Info Tool has <em><strong>seen</strong></em> the title and text
  of the notepad window.&nbsp; Whatever the Window Info Tool can see is what AutoIt can see.&nbsp;
  Now we have enough information to identify this exact window even if there are
  lots of other notepad windows open.&nbsp; In this case we use:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="codebox"> WinWaitActive(&quot;Untitled - Notepad&quot;,
  &quot;This is some text!&quot;)</p>
<p class="code">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Window Text</h2>
<p>The window text consists of all the text that AutoIt can &quot;see&quot;.&nbsp;
  This will usually be things like the contents of edit controls (as above with
  &quot;This is a line of text&quot;) but will also include other text like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;Button text like &amp;Yes, &amp;No, &amp;Next (the &amp; indicates
    an underlined letter)</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Dialog text like &quot;Are you sure you wish to continue?&quot;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Control text</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Misc text - sometimes you don't know what it is :)</li>
</ul>
<p>The important thing is that you can use the text along with the title to uniquely
  identify a window to work with.</p>
<p>When you specify the <em><strong>text</strong></em> parameter in a window function
  it is treated as a substring.&nbsp; So for the example above if you used the
  text &quot;is some &quot; you would get a match.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What has been described is the <em>default</em> mode that AutoIt operates in,
  there are a number of more <a href="windowsadvanced.html">advanced modes</a>
  to use when things are not as simple as this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
