The NEC PC-8801 system was introduced by the NEC Corporation in 1981 and was an early Zilog Z80-based computer. The PC-88, as it is informally called, became very popular in Japan but did not see release in other markets.


Hardware
CPU: PD9002 (NEC-PD7008 compatible) 
Resolutions: 640x200, 640x400, 320x200, 320x400 
Memory: 1.5 MB ROM, 512 KB RAM 
Sound: 3 FM channels + 3 SSG + 6 rhythms + 1 ADPCM 
For its time, the PC-8801 offered a high display resolution, although it could only display 8 out of 512 colors simultaneously. Its sound-producing capabilities were also more advanced than other machines of the time.


Software
Companies that produced exclusive software for this platform include Enix, Square, Falcom, Bandai Soft, Hal Laboratory, ASCII, Pony, T&E Soft, Champion Soft, Starcraft, Micro Cabin, PSK, and Bothtec. Certain games produced for the PC-8801 found shared release with the MSX platform, such as those produced by Game Arts, ELF, and Konami. Many popular series first appeared on this computer, including Snatcher, Thexder, Dragon Slayer and Ys.

Nintendo licensed Hudson Soft to port some of Nintendo's Famicom titles for the system, including Excitebike, Balloon Fight, Tennis, Donkey Kong 3, Golf and Ice Climber, as well as unusual ports of Mario Bros. called Mario Bros. Special and Punch Ball Mario Bros.. Most notably, they produced for it a unique Super Mario Bros. game entitled Super Mario Bros. Special. The game has since fallen into obscurity, prompting some to call it the "true Lost Levels."

The system also had its own BASIC dialect, as was fairly common for 1980s home computers, called N88-BASIC.
