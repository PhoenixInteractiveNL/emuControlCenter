The PRIMO is a home computer which was developed in the 80's by a hungarian computer developer called SZTAKI. This is a 8 bit machine, with Z80 CPU. The hardware is realized modesty, but there are some interesting features in this machine. There are more than one product line. The series A has touch keyboard (works on capacitive way, this is the original Primo feeling). The series B has normal keyboard. There are tales about the series C and in this series was the ROM upgraded. We should take a mention about the Pro Primo, which has color screen. (There was a photo in a micro computer magazine near '86, and on this photo is a complete Pro Primo configuration, likely the one and only prototype.) 

The different series was sold with different RAM configurations. The BASIC (and the operating system of-course) is in a 16K ROM, and only the size of the RAM was changed. 

A-32: 16K ROM and 16K RAM 
A-48: 16K ROM and 32K RAM 
A-64: 16K ROM and 48K RAM 
B-64: 16K ROM and 48K RAM (normal keyboard, and some I/O implementations which left out from the series A)


SCREEN
The Primo has only monochrome (black and white) screen with 256x192 resolution. (By the hardware manual the the Primo can works with the resolution 256x256, but this is only a hardware option, nobody used it.) The resolution 256x192 is the same resolution that the ZX Spectrum can do, but without colors. The pixel frequency is onther tan the Spectrum, It is not 7 MHz, but 7.5 MHz, so the CPU frequency is 3.75 MHz, but the displayed area horizontaly is little smaller. The screen memory is at the end of the RAM, and it uses only 6K. The hardware can do double buffering, the secondary screen memory is accesible under the first 8K. The series A has the following starting screen: 


SOUND 

There is in the computer a speaker, which was called in the documentation "horn". This is a one bit sound generator like the PC Speaker in the PC-s. In that time, it was enough in a computer. 


TAPE 

In the hardware manual there is a complete circuit diagram about the tape interface. In the first view, it seems overcomplicated, but later one can realize that it is very tricky. The interface is a creative and good solution, the loading is also safe when the records are noisy. 


KEYBOARD 

In the series A there is a "keyboard" which works by capacitive principles. This was realy only a board. It is from the electronical view a strike of genius, but it is mainly unusable. In the series B and C there are normal (usable) keyboards. 


OTHER I/O 

In the series A there is a lot of empty space on the motherboard. There was developed some I/O connection on the motherboard, but not imlemented in the A series. In all series are tape interface. In the B and C series are two additional connector implemented, they are: 

Commodore type IEC serial interface (the ROM supports it only in the series C) 
Serial joystick interface (never heard and saw joystick, we think nobody use this)
OTHER PRIMO TYPES

Primo C was an experimental prototype, the precusor of the Pro/Primo.
Pro/Primo was prepared for the second School Computer Tender, with new desing (house, keyboard, and colors.
