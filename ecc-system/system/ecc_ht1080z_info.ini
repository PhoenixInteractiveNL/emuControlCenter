The HT-1080Z, HT-2080Z and HT-3080C computers were manufactured by Híradástechnika Szövetkezet in Budapest, Hungary from 1983 to 1986. The HT-1080Z was one of the first official school computers in Hungary.

Initial versions were unaltered VideoGenie I computers relabeled and mounted with an on-board Yamaha/General Instruments AY-3-8910 sound chip. (The EACA VideoGenie I was in turn slightly modified clone of the popular TRS-80 Model 1 with Level II BASIC. The Yamaha chip is the same one that appeared in other famous computer models, such as the Amstrad and the Atari ST.)

Later revisions of HT-1080Z were re-designed by Híradástechnika Szövetkezet to have accented Hungarian characters, modified ROM contents (BASIC extensions) and several peripherals.

The basic properties of the most popular HT-1080Z models are summarized here:
