The Adventure Vision is a self-contained (no external monitor is required) cartridge-based video game console released by Entex Industries in 1982. The Adventure Vision was Entex's second generation system. Their first console was the Entex select-a-game, released a year earlier in 1981.

Control is through a single multi-position joystick and two sets of four buttons, one on each side of the joystick, for ease of play by both left- and right-handed players.

An interesting feature of the Adventure Vision is its 'monitor.' Rather than using an LCD screen or an external television set like other systems of the time, the Adventure Vision uses a single vertical line of 40 red LEDs combined with a spinning mirror inside the casing. This allows for a screen resolution of 150 x 40 pixels. Another product using this technique was produced by Nintendo in the mid 1990s – the Virtual Boy – another product which while technically ahead of its time like the Adventure Vision was doomed to failure in the open market.

The game cartridges can be stored in spaces on top of the case.

Drawbacks to the Adventure Vision are its monochrome (red) screen as well as the mirror motor, which draws a great deal of power from the batteries. The latter problem can be solved easily by the use of the built-in AC adapter port.

Many casual fans dismiss the Adventure Vision as a failed handheld console. In fact, it was a tabletop console that was much too large and fragile to be used effectively for handheld purposes.

Entex released four games for the Adventure Vision:

Defender, based on the Williams Electronics arcade game of the same name 
Super Cobra, based on the Konami arcade game of the same name 
Turtles, based on the Konami arcade game of the same name 
Space Force, a clone of Atari's Asteroids arcade game
