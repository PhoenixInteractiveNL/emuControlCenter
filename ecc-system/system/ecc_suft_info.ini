The SuFami Turbo (????????), often compared to the Aladdin Deck Enhancer, is an accessory released by Bandai for Nintendo's Super Famicom system and was released in 1996.

System
This device is designed to sit on top of the Super Famicom, and features two cartridge slots. The premise behind this idea is that games could be produced at a much cheaper rate (not having to rely on Nintendo). Unlike the Aladdin Deck Enhancer, this device was officially approved by Nintendo under the provision that Bandai handle all the hardware manufacturing themselves.

The two cartridge slots are designed to share data between the games. The cartridge placed in slot 1 is the game that will be played, while the cartridge in slot 2 supplies additional data for use in the main game. Nine of the thirteen SuFami Turbo titles make use of this system.

Games that are linkable are identified by a yellow diagram showing a SuFami Turbo with either 1 or 2 cartridges in the lower right corner of the game box. If the pictures has 1 cart plugged into the SuFami Turbo, it is not linkable. If it has 2 carts plugged into the SuFami Turbo then it is linkable with the games mentioned on the box.

Of the thirteen games released, nine of them were designed with the ability to link up, but not every game can be linked with every other game. Only certain combinations exist, and those combinations only exist within series of the same game.

In Japan, the SuFami Turbo was released as a standalone unit, or with a pack in game. There is a list of known pack in games below.

The advertising pamphlet that comes packaged with the SuFami Turbo features Tetris 2 + Bombliss. This game was never released for the system, but was released as a standalone SNES game.

Games
The system was designed with lower development times and cheaper games in mind. Games debuted for ¥3980, with many offering the ability to link for added playability. Not all of the 13 released games had the ability to link however. Each game's box had a little picture in the lower left corner indicating whether linking was possible or not.
