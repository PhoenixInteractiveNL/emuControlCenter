The Game Boy was a huge success for Nintendo. It was the second portable system created by Nintendo (the first being the Game & Watch series starting in 1980). The original Game Boy was released in 1989 and allowed game players to play a huge library of games away from home. Games like Super Mario Land, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening and Tetris proved that quality games could be developed for portable use.

Nintendo later released the 'Play it Loud' Game Boy series in 5 colors, and the redesigned slimmed down Game Boy pocket version was released in 1996.
