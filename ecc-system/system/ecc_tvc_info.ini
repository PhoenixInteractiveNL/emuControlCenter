description = "
The TV Computer (TVC) was a home computer made by the Hungarian company Videoton around 1986. The computer was based on the Enterprise (computer) and had a built-in BASIC interpreter. Programs could be loaded via tape[3] or floppy.

It had a built-in joystick, and a keyboard with Hungarian letters and nine function keys.

There were three different models:

TVC 32k had 32K of memory.
TVC 64k had 64K of memory.
TVC 64k+ also had 64K of memory, but had a newer BASIC interpreter (v2.2) and more video RAM (64K instead of 16K).
The TVC had three graphical modes: 128×240/16 colors, 256×240/4 colors, and 512×240/2 colors (black and white).

Few programs existed for the TVC. Many of these were written by dedicated amateurs and distributed by mail.
