In March of 1999, Bandai released a portable gaming console in Japan that was designed to compete with the Neo Geo Pocket and Game Boy Color. The machine was met with rave reviews and has gained a major share of the handheld market. The WS was available in ten case colors, playable both vertically and horizontally, and features a fairly large library of games.

In December of 2000, Bandai followed up its WonderSwan with the WonderSwan Color. Designed to continue the fight against Nintendo's Game Boy empire, the WSC is equipped with a color display and improved specifications. The WonderSwan Color is backwards compatible with the WonderSwan's black and white library, as well as having games of its own. Remakes of the older Final Fantasy games and many other RPGs make the WonderSwan Color a popular system in Japan.
