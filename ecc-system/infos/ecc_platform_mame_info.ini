MAME is an emulator application designed to recreate the hardware of arcade game systems in software, with the intent of preserving gaming history and preventing vintage games from being lost or forgotten. The name is an acronym for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator.

The first public MAME release (0.1) was on February 5, 1997, by Nicola Salmoria. As of version 0.121 (actually the 165th proper release), released November 19, 2007, the emulator now supports 3677 unique games and 6900 actual ROM image sets and is growing all the time. However, not all of the games in MAME are currently playable; 851 ROM sets are marked as not working in the current version, and 35 are not actual games but BIOS ROM sets. The project is currently coordinated by Aaron Giles.


Design
The MAME core coordinates the emulation of several elements at the same time. These elements replicate the behavior of the hardware present in the original arcade machines. MAME can emulate many different central processing units (CPUs), both in number or types, including processors, audio and video specific chips, integrated circuits, microcontrollers, etc., including the needed elements for them to communicate together such as memory regions, RAM, data buses, peripherals, storage devices, etc. These elements are virtualized so MAME acts as a software layer between the original program of the game, and the platform MAME runs on.

Individual arcade systems are specified by drivers which take the form of C macros. These drivers specify the individual components to be emulated and how they communicate with each other.


Emulation philosophy
The stated aim of the project is to document hardware, and so MAME takes a somewhat purist view of emulation, prohibiting programming hacks that might make a game run improperly or run faster at the expense of emulation accuracy (see UltraHLE, a project aimed to run games at a playable speed). In MAME every emulated component is replicated down to the smallest level of individual registers and instructions. Consequently, MAME emulation is very accurate (in many cases pixel- and sample-accurate), but system requirements can be high. Since MAME runs mostly older games, a large majority of the games run well on a 2 GHz PC. More modern arcade machines are based on fast pipelined RISC processors, math DSPs, and other devices which are difficult to emulate efficiently. These systems may not run quickly even on the most modern systems available.

The MAME team has not diverged from this purist philosophy to take advantage of 3D hardware available on PCs today. It is a common but incorrect assumption that performance problems are due to some games' use of 3D graphics. However, even with graphics disabled, games using RISC processors and other modern hardware are not emulated any faster. Thus taking advantage of 3D hardware would not speed these games up significantly. In addition, using 3D hardware would make it difficult to guarantee identical output between different brands of cards, or even revisions of drivers on the same card, which goes against the MAME philosophy. Consistency of output across platforms is very important to the MAME team.

Game data
 
MacMAME under Mac OS X running Progear.Main article: ROM image
In most arcade machines, the data (consisting of the game program, graphics, sounds, etc.) is stored in read-only memory chips (hence the name 'ROM'), although other devices such as cassettes, floppy disks, hard disks, laserdiscs, and compact discs are also used. Most of these devices can be copied to computer files, in a process called 'dumping'. The resulting files are often generically called ROM images or ROMs regardless of the kind of storage they came from.

To play a particular game, MAME requires a set of files called a ROM set. They contain all the data from the original machine; however, MAME itself does not include any of these files. For analog media, such as laserdiscs and magnetic tapes with audio/video data, it is impossible to make a 100% accurate digital copy. The process necessarily involves an analogue-digital conversion and the resultant reduction in quality.

MAME uses two different file types for storing ROMs depending on the original medium:

The majority of ROM dumps are stored in raw format and contained in ZIP archives, one for each game. 
For arcade machines which use hard disks or CDs, MAME uses CHD (Compressed Hunks of Data) files which contain the entire contents of the original hard disk, CD or Laserdisc. Due to the large size of these media, the CHD files derived from them also tend to be large. 


Parents and clones
Original ROM sets ('parent'): the games which the MAME development team has decided are the 'original' versions of each game. Except for the files contained in BIOS ROMs (if needed; see below), the ROM files for these games contain everything those games need to run. The 'original' set is generally defined as the most recent revision of the game, and if multiple regional versions are available, the 'World' or US revision. 
Clone ROM sets: different versions or variants of the originals. For example, Street Fighter II Turbo is considered a variant of Street Fighter II Champion Edition. 
BIOS ROM sets: the ROMs in common between all games on various standardized arcade systems (e.g. Neo-Geo). They basically boot the hardware and then allow the regular game software to take over. 


Naming convention
A single supported game is usually referred to as a ROM set. Usually each game will consist of multiple ROM files, each of which represents a single device (usually ROM, but sometimes other devices such as PALs). The MAME developers assign each ROM set an 8-letter name for identification as well as a description associated with that 8-letter name. Examples:

Original ROM: hyperpac 'Hyper Pacman' - MAME expects all required ROM images in a folder (or ZIP file) called hyperpac. 
Clone ROM: hyperpcb 'Hyper Pacman (bootleg)' - MAME will look in both the parent folder (hyperpac) and the clone folder (hyperpcb) for the files. 
Individual ROM files are often named after labels found on the ROM chips and the position they are located on the board in the format 'label.position'. Sega for example use a standard labeling scheme for all the ROMs found on their arcade boards giving each unique ROM chip a unique label. 'mpr12380.b2' is a ROM from the Golden Axe romset. This implies that the rom was labeled 'mpr12380' and located in position 'b2' on the PCB. By using such a naming scheme it makes it easy to use MAME to identify, and often help repair, non-working PCBs.

The 8-letter identification tags are less standardized and usually left to the discretion of individual developers. Although some standards do exist, the descriptive long names often follow naming conventions set by the original game manufacturers. For example, Sunset Riders by Konami:

ssriders 'Sunset Riders (4 Players ver EAC)' (This is the parent set, with clones following) 
ssrdrebd 'Sunset Riders (2 Players ver EBD)' 
ssrdrebc 'Sunset Riders (2 Players ver EBC)' 
ssrdruda 'Sunset Riders (4 Players ver UDA)' 
ssrdreaa 'Sunset Riders (4 Players ver EAA)' 
ssrdruac 'Sunset Riders (4 Players ver UAC)' 
ssrdrubc 'Sunset Riders (2 Players ver UBC)' 
ssrdrabd 'Sunset Riders (2 Players ver ABD)' 
ssrdradd 'Sunset Riders (4 Players ver ADD)' 
ssrdrjbd 'Sunset Riders (2 Players ver JBD)' 
Konami gave each revision of their later games a very specific and clearly visible version number, from the mid 90s onwards. As these represent an easy way to identify each version of the game, including the region in which it was available and the revision of the code, MAME uses this information to identify each set. UAA is American revision A, while ABD is Asian revision D. For companies where it is less clear sets are often simply labeled as '(set 1)' and '(set 2)'. Unreleased games are labeled as '(Prototype)' and non-original versions of games are labeled as '(Bootleg)'
